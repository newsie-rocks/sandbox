      "The AWK Programming Language, Second EditionThe AWK Programming Language, Second EditionUpdatedWed Jun 28 06:46:29 EDT 2023IntroductionThis page is a placeholder for material related to the second edition ofThe AWK Programming Language.The first edition was written by Al Aho, Brian Kernighan and Peter Weinbergerin 1988.  Awk has evolved since then, there are multiple implementations,and of course the computing world has changed enormously.  The newedition of the Awk book reflects some of those changes.The book will be available by the end of September.  In themeantime, we will add material that we hope will be of interest --historical documents, bits of code, and occasional essays on Awk andrelated topics.Awk Source and DocumentationAwk source is maintained athttps://github.com/onetrueawk/awk.Gawk releases are athttps://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk;the Gawk manual ishere.Arnold Robbins has compiled a list ofother implementationsof Awk.Historical DocumentsThe citations in the original Awk book have by now become quite dusty,but some of the material is still interesting and potentially useful.Here are references to some of the documents, perhaps updated.AWK - A Pattern Scanning and Processing Language,the original Awk paper fromSoftware Practice and Experience, 1979.CSTR 118:An internal technical report on Awk, dated June 1985, so it's not theoriginal language but more or less the one described in the Awk bookin 1988.dformat:   Dformat is an Awk program, originally written by Jon Bentley,   for drawing data-format diagrams.   The version here comes from Arnold Robbins (to whom thanks),   who has fixed it up and made it work properly in today's environments.chem:Chem was an experiment in little languages, a language for describing chemicalstructure diagrams.  (Think benzene rings on steroids.)  It wasn't much usedbut it was a good exercise.The link above is to a somewhat blurry but complete PDF of the original chem paperby Bentley, Lynn Jelinski and bwk, published inComputational Chemistryin1987.indexing programs:One of the examples in the original Awk book was a simplified version of indexing toolsfirst created by Jon Bentley, and used both for both editions of the book.  The linkabove provides the code; the paper published inElectronic Publishing -- Origination Dissemination and Designin 1988is temporarily unavailable.Algorithm animation:   by Jon Bentley and bwk.The paperA System for Algorithm Animation(1991) describes asystem for embedding simple graphics commands in program output thatcould be used to display an \"animated\" version of the output.  It allworked on monochrome displays, so it's totally dated now, but it wasneat at the time.

      "Practical Procedural Macros | xy2xy2.devPractical Procedural MacrosLast updated2022-06-28Summary: An explaination of how to implement practical procedural macros intheRustprogramming language. Explains thedifferent types of macros, then shows animplementation of a procedural macro following best practices, focusingon testing and ergonomics.Assumes some familiarity with Rust.InRust, amacrois code that writes other code, enablingmetaprogramming.Rust uses macros to add features on top of the core language, liketheprintln!()macro, providing variadic arguments and stringinterpolation. They can also be used for code generation,removing the need for error-prone copy-and-paste programming. Macros are evenpowerful enough to createdomain-specific languages, ortype-checkedSQL at compile-time.When should you use or not use procedural macros?To be clear -most of the time, you don't need procedural macros.If you want to use a declarative macro in#[my_macro]or#[derive(MyMacro)position, then use themacro_rules_attributelibrary.If you need more complicated logic in your declarative macros, take a look atThe Little Book of Rust Macrosif you can use their techniques.Declarative macros, the classic form of macros, rely on purely declarativelogic. They look something like this:macro_rules!expr {(eval$a:expr+ $b: expr)=>{println!(\"{}\",$a+$b);}}expr!(eval1+2);// evaluates toprintln!(\"{}\",1+2);They use their own separate, declarative language. But declarative macros arenot without wartsand are pretty hard to understand if they get bigger andbigger.Rust introducted procedural macros inRust1.30for custom#[attributes]. Unlike declarative macros,proc macros use Rust directly, so you're writing the macros in the samelanguage, which makes it much easier to scale. For this reason, you shouldconsider proc macros if you need to deal with a large macro.But procedural macros have drawbacks. First, to do anything practical, you'lllikely need thesynlibrary, notorious for long build times. And second,there are still many footguns left in proc macros today. This guide willexplain the ones I know of.Note that once you do invest into procedural macros, it's easier to writethe next ones, because a fair bit of the cost is up-front.Overall, consider procedural macros if one of these applies:You need to develop a large, complex macro and are hitting declarative macrolimitations.Your declarative macro has grown too large and hard to understand, and youneed to extend it further.You need complex procedural logic in your macro.A short primerThere arethree differenttypesofprocedural macros:function like:my_macro!(...)derive macros:#[derive(MyMacro)]attribute macros:#[my_macro(arguments)]These types differ only by their syntax when invoked. Function-like, as theirname suggests, act like your usual declarative macros.Derive macros can apply in any#[derive(..)]block. This makes them mostinteresting for macros that need to generate code on structs.Attributes macros are a more general version, which can be applied to any\"item\" in Rust: structs, traits, functions, types and so on. Thetokio::mainmacro is agood example of why to use this kind of macro: it decorates a main function,without having to add an extra level of indentation. Compare with the functionlike syntax:tokio_main! {// extra indentationfnmain() {println!(\"hello world\")}}The most important difference is procedural macros operate on tokens, not theAST directly, so the proc macro has to reimplement parsing of Rust source code.This is most often done withsyn.Procedural macros arecompiler extensions: they are currently run as part ofthe compiler. This is the main reason why they have to be declared in aseparatecrate.Finally, proc macros are not fully hygienic (it'scomplicated). Mostimportantly, like declarative macros, they are not path hygenic, so you need touse full paths, eg.std::thread::spawn, or includeusestatements if youcan.Usecargo-expandto manually testand see the output of a macro.Creating a proc macroAs we have to declare the proc macro in a separate crate, and assuming we havesome code already, we'll need at least two crates: one for your proc macros andanother one for the rest of your code.I recommend using aworkspaceto organise this. Workspaces are anintegrated way within Cargo to have multiple crates. If you use other systemsto build your macro code, take a look at the proc macro Rust rules forgnorBazel.Here's an example with two crates, your library crate and the proc macro crate.You'll need to create the workspace layout yourself as there is no tool to doso automatically yet.my_project/             // new folder├─ my_crate/│  ├─ Cargo.toml│  ├─ lib.rs├─ my_crate_proc_macro/ // macro crate (cargo new --lib my_crate_proc_macro)│  ├─ Cargo.toml│  ├─ lib.rs├─ Cargo.toml           // new fileNow to declare the proc macro:# my_crate_proc_macro/Cargo.toml[lib]proc-macro=trueAdd your newly declared proc macro crate as a dependency to your main crate'sCargo.toml, so it can use it:# my_crate/Cargo.toml[dependencies]my_crate_proc_macro= {path=\"../my_crate_proc_macro\"}Then add the workspace at the top level, above the two crates:# Cargo.toml[workspace]members= [\"my_crate\",\"my_crate_proc_macro\",]Here's an example of an function-like proc-macro. Add the#[proc_macro]attribute to a function in your proc macro crate to make it a proc macro.Each kind of proc macro has a different signature, but they all take and returnTokenStream,a list of tokens.#[proc_macro]pub fnmy_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -> proc_macro::TokenStream {item}Foundational crates for best practices proc macrosIt's possible to use proc macros without any dependencies, but using thesewill save you trouble and headaches over the long run.Testing:proc_macro2This crate is a wrapper around theproc_macrocrate from the compiler, whichyou use to create a proc macro. However,proc_macrois not usable innon proc-macro contexts, meaning you can't use it in tests.proc_macro2is a wrapper around the compiler crate. This means, mostimportantly for us, that you can use the proc macro in tests.Many other crates in the ecosystems have separate functions forproc_macroandproc_macro2, for examplesyn::parsevssyn::parse2.Here's an example of howproc_macro2can be useful. In this example,we separate the parts withproc_macroandproc_macro2, and test theproc_macro2parts. The actualproc macro does a roundtrip fromproc_macro2structures and back. (Do not usethe test in this example, see below.)#[proc_macro]pub fnmy_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -> proc_macro::TokenStream {my_macro_impl(item.into()).into()}fnmy_macro_impl(_item: proc_macro2::TokenStream) -> proc_macro2::TokenStream {\"fn macro_generated() -> u32 {42}\".parse().unwrap()}#[cfg(test)]modtests {use super::*;#[test]fnunit() {// test for illustrative purposes// do not use this test, see `quote` section belowassert_eq!(my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\"fn macro_generated() -> u32 { 42 }\");}}Creating trees:quoteIn our test, we converted theTokenStreams to strings, because they don'timplementEq, so we can't compare them directly.Can you spot the error in the test?assert_eq!(my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\"fn macro_generated() -> u32 { 42 }\");The proper result is actually\"fn macro_generated () -> u32 { 42 }\", with aspace betweenmacro_generatedand the().To test this macro, we used the string conversion ofTokenStream, which justoutputs each distinct token with a space between, stripping newlines.To avoid this, convert to and from aTokenStream:assert_eq!(my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\"fn macro_generated() -> u32 { 42 }\".parse::<proc_macro2::TokenStream>().unwrap().to_string());As you can see, this way is pretty error prone. At this point you'd likely makea helper.The confusion stems from our using strings as a way torepresent Rust source code, because we must create theTokenStreamby somemethod. Here, we confused a string with code written raw, but notconverted, with one converted from aTokenStream.There's a more convenient way: the third-partyquotecrate, turning any codepassed into a token tree directly.quotehas a few niceties, includinginterpolation and repetition.Here's the previous example rewritten to usequote:usequote::quote;#[proc_macro]pub fnmy_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -> proc_macro::TokenStream {my_macro_impl(item.into()).into()}fnmy_macro_impl(_item: proc_macro2::TokenStream) -> proc_macro2::TokenStream {quote! {fnmacro_generated() ->u32{42}}}#[cfg(test)]modtests {use super::*;#[test]fnunit() {assert_eq!(my_macro_impl(quote!(\"\")).to_string(),quote! {fnmacro_generated() ->u32{42}}.to_string());}}We'll see more of the power ofquoteas we go. Overall, it's morea convenience than anything, though be careful when testing if you choose notto use it.Parsing Rust:synWhat if our macro takes some Rust input, and we want to parse it? There are twochoices.First, we can manually parse the subset of Rust we want. This is doable butespecially tedious. If you choose to go this route, the best way to go isprobably looking at macros not usingsyn,doc-comment's sourcecodecould be a good starting point. You save out on the long compile times ofsyn.However, this is painful, and brittle in the face of new syntax, so you'llprobably want to usesynif you're doing anything pretty complex.We've talked a lot about tokens so far, but not so much aboutsyntaxtrees. Putsimply, abstract syntax trees are much easier to deal with than tokens, as theydon't need to represent details in the real syntax, like the parentheses andbrackets, as well as the actual symbols you type out in source code.Here's the abstract syntax tree for a simplepub fn main() {}:Item::Fn {attrs: [],vis: Visibility::Public(Pub,),sig: Signature {constness: None,asyncness: None,unsafety: None,abi: None,fn_token: Fn,ident: Ident {sym: main,span:bytes(8..12),},generics: Generics {lt_token: None,params: [],gt_token: None,where_clause: None,},paren_token: Paren,inputs: [],variadic: None,output: ReturnType::Default,},block: Block {brace_token: Brace,stmts: [],},}Of course,syncan parse any Rust syntax, not just functions.I recommend using theAST Explorerand putting Rustcode in. This is an easy way to see what data is available on ansynAST.Here's an example that reverses the name of the function.For this example, we're using an attribute macro. It takes an extraargument (theargumentsin#[my_macro(arguments)]).usequote::quote;#[proc_macro_attribute]pub fnmy_macro(_attr: proc_macro::TokenStream,item: proc_macro::TokenStream,) -> proc_macro::TokenStream {my_macro_impl(_attr.into(), item.into()).into()}fnmy_macro_impl(_attr: proc_macro2::TokenStream,item: proc_macro2::TokenStream,) -> proc_macro2::TokenStream {let mutfunc: syn::ItemFn= matchsyn::parse2(item.clone()) {Ok(it)=>it,Err(e)=> returne.into_compile_error(),};letident=func.sig.ident;letreversed: String=ident.to_string().chars().rev().collect();func.sig.ident=syn::Ident::new(&reversed, ident.span());quote! {#func }}#[cfg(test)]modtests {use super::*;#[test]fnunit() {assert_eq!(my_macro_impl(quote!(\"\"),quote! {fnmy_function(a:u32) {}}).to_string(),quote! {fnnoitcnuf_ym(a:u32) {}}.to_string());}}We usesyn::parse2to parseinto the type on the left, here anItemFnwhich is a function.As an aside,because the macro may be applied to something else than a function, eg. infront on a struct, we might not be able to parse a function. In this case webail and return the error.The naive way to do this would be to panic, but this gives subpar errormessages (proc macro panicked). So it would be nice at least to reusesyn'serror.But we can't return an error in proc macros - only tokens. Themain way around this is to return tokens containingcore::compile_errorfrom the Rust standard library.When that compile error is evaluated, it will return a nice compiler error forthe user. There's a convenientinto_compile_error()insynto do this.Testing compiler errors:trybuildWe've talked a bit about errors. It would be nice to solidfy this in ourtests: let's test our errors.Problem: an error message isn't just a message, so testing macro expansionslike we did before is missing a bit of the picture. Here's what a parse errorlooks like for our macro currently, when we try to apply it, for example, to astruct:error: expected `fn`--> src/main.rs:3:1|3 | struct A;| ^^^^^^We have the error message, generated bysynwithinto_compile_error:expected `fn`.But that's not all. Under the error is the code it appliesto highlighted.This is why strings aren't enough for macros. On top of the code, Rust includesaSpan,that describes where the token was in the original code. (Spans are also usedformacro hygienepurposes, mainlyrelevant for identifiers.)Okay, so how do we test compiler errors? I recommend usingtrybuild. Let's try it out with ourerror output from above put intests/struct.stderr:// tests/struct.rsusemy_crate_proc_macro::my_macro;#[my_macro]structA;modtests {// ...#[test]fncompile_errors() {lett=trybuild::TestCases::new();t.compile_fail(\"tests/*.rs\");}}For each test that it finds,trybuildwill compile it, check that it failsand compare the error output to the corresponding.stderrfile.trybuildcan generate these.stderrfiles for you as well.SummaryI hope this article has given you a good overview of procedural macros, as wellas how to get started in a practical manner.Proc macros are (too?) complicated, and the lack of a fully integrated guidehurts their usability. The documention is there, just scattered around,and it's hard to get started.If you're looking for goodpractice, the best resource is likely theProc MacroWorkshopmade by David Tolnay,the author of many of the libraries listed here.\n",

(WBTV) - A airplane dealing with mechanical issues landed at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport on Wednesday morning.According to the airport, Delta Airlines Flight 1092 landed around 8:40 a.m. on Runway 36 Left. Photos provided by passengers show the plane landed without the nose gear.The airplane has been removed from the runway, which was closed for hours while crews worked to remove it. Nobody was injured in the incident and passengers were bussed to a terminal.The aircraft has been removed from Runway 18R/36L and the inspection is complete. The runway is now open. Please continue to check with your airline on updated flight status.— CLT Airport (@CLTAirport)June 28, 2023A passenger on the plane said via text that they were allowed to leave, but nothing was allowed off the plane - no suitcases or carry-ons.He said they were told the Federal Aviation Administration has a hold on the plane so nothing can move on it or from it. The passenger added he was headed to a work meeting in an Uber with no wallet.“Just so thankful and just a big smile on my face that I was able to hear my wife, my mom, and my kids,” said passenger Gary Gibbs.A relieved Gibbs said there were anxious moments as Flight 1092 approached the runway, and described the moment it touched down.“We came to a full stop,” Gibbs said. “There was some smoke in the cabin so that was a little bit concerning, but the flight attendants did well. The pilot came on with his instructions that we would be exiting, and so we all exited safely.”Another passenger recorded the moment the flight landed at the airport. The plane can be heard hitting the runway and sliding to a stop.Passenger Edward Cates recorded the moment the plane landed at the airport without its nose gear down. The plane can be heard hitting the ground.Delta said two pilots, three flight attendants and 96 customers were aboard the plane when it landed.In a tweet, the National Transportation Safety Board said it is investigating the runway landing without the plane’s nose gear extended.NTSB investigating the runway landing of a Boeing 712 without the nose gear extended at Charlotte/Douglas International airport in Charlotte, North Carolina.— NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom)June 28, 2023Following the emergency landing, Delta released the statement below:“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and employees. While this was a rare occurrence, Delta flight crews train extensively to safely manage through many scenarios and flight 1092 landed safely without reported injuries. Our focus is now to take care of our customers on this flight, including retrieving their bags and seeing them to their final destinations safely. We apologize to our customers for what they experienced.”The plane arrived in Charlotte after taking off from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta.According toFlightAware, more than 220 flights have been delayed already on Wednesday, and at least 31 have been canceled.AutoplayCaptionWBTV found four incidents involving landing gear failure in the United States in the last three years among commercial air carriers. The most recent nose landing found was Jan. 4, 2022, in Albany, New York. More recently, an aircraft in Belgium had its landing gear snap when it attempted to land just after takeoff.A Delta spokesperson in Atlanta described the incident as unusual, saying: I’ve been in the industry 20 years, I think I’ve seen one other one in 20 years of this type, so it’s very rare. We treat them all very seriously and will understand exactly what drive it and put those corrective actions in place.”Passenger Gary Gibbs shot video of Delta Flight 1092 after it safely landed without nose gear at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.Download the freeWBTV News appfor updates and breaking news.Watch continuing live coverage here:Copyright 2023 WBTV.

On 22 May 1973, Bob Metcalf authored a memo that described ‘X-Wire’, a 3Mbps common bus office network system.There are very few networking technologies from the early 70s that have proven to be so resilient (TCP/IP is the only other major networking technology from that era that I can recall), so it’s worth looking at Ethernet a little closer in order to see why it has enjoyed such an unusual longevity.Hang on, was that 3Mbps? True, the initial Ethernet specification passed data at a rate of 2.94Mbps, not 10Mbps. That came later, as did the subsequent refinements to the Ethernet technology that allowed data transfer rates of 100Mbps, 1Gbps, and then 100Gbps. Terabit Ethernet (TbE) is on the way, by all accounts.Why has Ethernet endured as an ubiquitous data framing protocol over all these years? What was the difference between Ethernet and a variety of other emerging technologies for local area networking, such as Token Ring, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), or Distributed-queue dual-bus (DQDB)? Why didn’t we adopt simple HDLC serial framing? What’s so special about Ethernet?The first question to ask is — has Ethernet really endured? Well, not really. You couldn’t take a piece of 75-ohm coaxial cable from the 1970s, increase the speed of the clocks in the electronics and run a common bus local area network using a data clocking rate of 200Gps. That just won’t work.So, today’s high-speed Ethernet networks have some bits in common with the earlier Ethernet networks, and some are radically different. However, it is still possible to take an Ethernet packet frame off a high-speed Ethernet network and pass it into a 10Mbps Ethernet LAN. The Ethernet packet framing protocol and the station addressing plan are both largely unchanged.Perhaps we should start this look at Ethernet from the perspective of 50 years ago and look at why Ethernet was so interesting for computer communications.There is an intriguing mix of simplicity and ingenuity within the original Ethernet design. On the one hand, it was surprising what Ethernet did not do — there was no explicit acknowledgement of the successful receipt of a packet, nor any indication of any form of network failure, such as network segmentation.There was no consistent network ‘clock’ to impose a common time regimen upon the stream of digital pulses, nor any form of imposition of fair sharing of the common network to competing demands, which was at the time a conventional expectation for any shared communications medium.Nor was there any level of predictability within the system. Individual transmissions might wait for an indeterminate time before they could transmit, which means that there was the potential for network-imposed jitter. There was no flow control or any form of prioritization.The Ethernet design was not full duplex. Every transmission was heard by all attached devices. On the other hand, even though there was no overarching network controller within the Ethernet architecture, the common bus Ethernet model at that time was surprisingly effective at congestion management and was possible to achieve sustained Ethernet loads of over 90% of the total rated capacity.In the 1970s, most packet-switched networks used point-to-point serial lines and used a basic framing format to wrap the payload packets. The preamble might contain some address fields and a control code to indicate the role of the packet (such as control, information, or data) and possibly a length field. The packet would normally have a checksum attached and some kind of end-of-frame marker. There was no need to attach addresses to this media-level packet framing, given that in a point-to-point link there was only one possible destination for the packet on the wire, namely the other end!However, with the shift in the computing environment away from large central mainframe computers towards a clustered environment of smaller computers linked by a common network, there was also an opportunity to introduce a multi-client network technology that allowed a collection of computers to communicate between themselves without the need for a single central controller to mediate these communications. Ethernet applied a design approach of a common shared bus to this space. Each client connected to a common medium and could then communicate directly with any, or all, other connected clients.Of course, the design of Ethernet didn’t appear out of nowhere. Its influential predecessor was a radio network developed at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s,ALOHAnet. The original service objective of ALOHAnet was a low-cost radio network that connected remote users to a central mainframe computer.ALOHAnet used a hub-and-spoke model where the hub broadcasts data packets over radio to send to all clients on a single outbound channel on which all clients listened, and the hub listened to all clients on a separate single inbound channel (Figure 1). If the hub correctly received a packet, then it sent a short acknowledgement packet (again on the outbound common broadcast channel).The client’s behaviour was to send a packet on the inbound channel and wait for an acknowledgement. If an acknowledgment was not received by a client after a short wait interval, it would attempt retransmission. To avoid various forms of congestion-related deadlock the retransmission process entailed a further delay by waiting for a randomly selected time interval. This acknowledgment mechanism was used to detect and correct collisions created when two client machines both attempted to send a packet at the same time on the same common inbound radio channel. As this was a multi-host network, each attached client was given a unique address, and each packet included the address of the intended recipient.Figure 1 — ALOHAnet design.Ethernet took this two-channel radio behaviour and mapped it with only a common piece of cable, or abus. Each attached client machine could transmit on this common bus, and all other clients would hear the transmission. The Ethernet design had removed the hub from ALOHAnet and allowed any client to send a packet directly to any other attached client (or all clients, using a broadcast address). Ethernet was an instance of adistributed access system.The installation and operation of an Ethernet were extremely simple. A single segment of 75-ohm coaxial cable was unrolled around the office environment, passing nearby various workstation client computers. The specifications allowed for a cable segment of up to 500m and three such segments could be linked by repeaters, allowing a total cable length of 1.5km. Workstation clients are attached to the cable by an Ethernet transceiver that uses a so-called vampire tap to connect to the inner conductor of the coaxial cable, and a control unit to process the analogue signal on the cable to digital signals to be passed back to the client workstation (Figure 2).Figure 2 — Ethernet 10Base5 transceiver.So, where’s the magic here? The best place to start answering this question is by looking at the second generation of the technology, the 1980 Ethernet specification (PDF), published by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel, and Xerox (DIX), which was a refinement of the earlier Xerox work.No clock!In looking at an Ethernet frame, firstly, and perhaps surprisingly for a high-speed system, Ethernet is asynchronous. The common wire does not provide a constant clocking signal that serves as the substrate for clocked data. Each transceiver operates its own autonomous data clock.The Ethernet frame starts with an enforced idle time of 96-bit times (or 9.6 µseconds), followed by a 64-bit preamble. The preamble is an alternating pattern of 1 0 1 0… terminating with two 1s in bits 63 and 64. The purpose of the preamble is simple — it sets the clocking rate for the subsequent data packet.Every client’s task is to look for activity on the wire and synchronize its local oscillator against the implicit clock signal being received in the preamble. Once the receiver’s oscillator is in sync with the data, it only has to stay in sync for a further 1,518 bytes, or 12,144 bits, or just a little over one millisecond at 10Mbps.Ethernet used Manchester encoding where a logical 0 is represented by a high-to-low signal transition and a logic 1 is represented by a low-to-high transition. All 1s or all 0s would correspond to a 20Mhz square wave (Figure 3). There’s no doubt that making a 20Mhz clock stable for 1 millisecond is a somewhat cheaper and easier task than making a clock stable for some years!Figure 3 — Manchester encoding.Any size you want!Well, no, not really. The Ethernet specification allowed for individual Ethernet frame payloads to be between 46 and 1,500 bytes (Figure 4). A minimal IPv4 TCP/IP acknowledgement packet is 40 bytes, which fits comfortably into an Ethernet frame, while a 1,500-byte frame carries a 24-byte overhead or 1.57% media overhead. Even when you allow for the 9.6 µsecond interframe gap, the media overhead for maximum-sized Ethernet packets is still a very reasonable 2.3%.Figure 4 — Ethernet frame.The outcome of this variable-sized packet encoding is the ability to maximize the efficiency of the media layer, allowing both small and large packets to be carried without excessive overhead and without excessive payload padding.The cost of variable-sized packets is increased potential for network-induced jitter, where a clocked real-time stream of data may have its timing altered as it passes through an Ethernet network. In a single-channel medium with mixed packet sizes, small packets have to wait for any preceding large packets to complete. There is no orderly queue in Ethernet. If a client cannot send a packet immediately there is no scheduling queue to maintain any form of order between contending clients. Each client backs off for a random wait time.There is a trade-off between data timing and network utilization, and, like TCP itself, Ethernet opted to head down the path of producing maximal efficiency rather than sacrificing speed and capacity for the sake of preserving implicit data timing integrity. In retrospect, it proved to be an astute design decision.There is also an ingenious relationship between the minimum packet size and the Ethernet algorithm. The one thing Ethernet attempted to maintain was the property that a transmitter is always aware if another transmitter was active at the same time. Hence a packet must be big enough that the leading bit of the packet must be able to propagate to the other end of the Ethernet Local Area Networks (LAN), and the collision with the leading edge of another transmitter must propagate back to the original transmitter before the transmission ceases.That implies that the total end-to-end length of the LAN must be one-half the minimum frame size. You can make the minimum frame size smaller, but the maximal diameter of the LAN itself shrinks, or you can support physically longer LANs, but at the expense of less efficient payloads because of a larger minimum frame size.All this relates to the speed of electromagnetic propagation over a copper conductor, which in turn, relates to the speed of light in a vacuum.The speed of lightThe speed of light in a vacuum, or the physical sciences constant ‘c’, is probably the most researched constant in all of science. According to electromagnetic theory, its value, when measured in a vacuum, should not depend on the wavelength of the radiation. According to Einstein’s prediction about the speed of propagation of light within the general theory of relativity, the measured speed of light does not depend on the observer’s frame of reference; the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant.Estimates of the value of c have been undergoing refinement since 1638 when Galileo’s estimate of “If not instantaneous, it is extraordinarily rapid” was published in ‘Two New Sciences‘. The currently accepted value is 299,792.458 kilometres per second.The speed of light in glass or fibre-optic cable is significantly slower, at approximately 194,865 kilometres per second.The speed of propagation of electrical charge through a conductor is a related value; it, too, has been the subject of intense experimentation. Perhaps the most bizarre experiment was conducted in Paris, in April 1746, by Jean-Antoine Nollet. Using a snaking line of some 200 monks, connected by a mile-long iron wire, Nollet observed their reactions when he administered a powerful electric current through the wire. The simultaneous screams of the monks demonstrated that, as far as Nollet could tell, the voltage was transmitted through a conductor ‘instantaneously’.Further experimentation has managed to refine this estimate, and the current value of the speed of voltage propagation in copper is 224,844 kilometres per second, slightly faster than the speed of light through a fibre-optic cable.Relating this value back to the design of Ethernet, a 10Mbps system running over copper wire will carry bits at 0.75 the speed of light in a vacuum, or at 224,844 kilometres per second. This means that 576 bits at 10Mbps will be contained in 12,951m of copper cable. The original Ethernet design specifications allowed for a total sequence of three 500m runs of copper cable, plus allowance for two repeaters, and a generous allowance for error!Ethernet CSMA/CD designThe next piece of the Ethernet puzzle is the ingenious Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm, which, as we’ve already noted, was derived from the ALOHAnet design. A transmitter first waits for any current activity on the common bus wire to stop (Carrier Sense), and then it will wait for a further 9.6 µseconds (96 bits at 10Mbps) and then commence transmission of the frame, starting with the 64-bit preamble. While it is transmitting its frame it monitors the medium to ensure that no other transmission is taking place.If it detects another transmission during the sending of the frame (acollision), then the transmitter sends ajamsignal for another 32-bit times. The jam signal will also cause all other clients to receive a corrupted Ethernet frame and the checksum calculation will fail. The packet will then be discarded.After sending thejamsignal the sender then aborts the transmission andbacks offfor an interval, before trying again with the initial carrier sense step. The backoff interval is a multiple of aslot time(where aslotis 51.2 µseconds — the equivalent of the time to transmit 64 bytes, which is a minimum-sized Ethernet packet (less the preamble bits)).The backoff interval is calculated as a random number r where 0 <= r < 2k, and where k = MIN(n,10), where n is the frame’s collision counter. Thus, if a transmitter encounters a collision for the first time it will back off between 0 and 1 slot times (0 to 51.2 µseconds). If this results in a second collision then it will back off for a time of between 0 to 3 slot times (0 to 153.6 µseconds), and so on until the 10th collision for this frame gives a random wait interval of between 0 and 1,023 slot times.After the 16th blocked transmission attempt, the frame is discarded and the MAC layer reports an error (any resemblance to the packing efficiency of a hash array using exponentially spaced collision side chains is not a coincidence, and the packing outcomes for such hash tables and Ethernet are remarkably similar). So how long could a frame wait before being sent on the media? The worst case is just under half a second.Of course, the issue here is that the algorithm isfair, in that over time all transmitters will have an equal probability of being able to transmit on the channel. There is no controller, and no critical point of failure in a LAN, nor is any connected station reliant on the correct operation of any other connected station. Ethernet is indeed a peer network technology that operates in aplug-and-playfashion.Unique MAC addresses!The next Ethernet innovation was in client addressing. A common technique for networks at that time was to use short (often just eight bits in size) address fields and instruct the LAN administrator to configure each connected device with the next available address. That way the address fields in the packet took up minimal space, increasing the network’s carriage efficiency.Ethernet took an entirely different approach, and Ethernet (as well as IEEE 802.3 MAC addresses) used a 48-bit address field. Each manufacturer is assigned a block of numbers and adds a locally unique suffix to create a globally unique MAC address for each Ethernet device.What comes shipped from the network interface manufacturer is an Ethernet device with a globally unique address. This allows the end user to simply plug the device into any LAN with the knowledge that there will be no local address clash. Not only did this approach of using unique MAC addresses make wired networks easier to set up, but it also proved remarkably useful in more dynamic connection contexts, such as wireless 801.11 Wi-Fi networks, where devices can associate within a wireless service realm without causing havoc over clashing wireless addresses.It remains to be seen how long the 48-bit address field will last, but it has been pointed out that if you manufacture 2B Ethernet devices a day, it will take 385 years to run through this 48-bit address space!Ethernet evolutionFrom a technical perspective, Ethernet achieved an elegance in simplicity by avoiding over-engineering the technology. But it took more than that to achieve the level of ubiquity that Ethernet has enjoyed in the face of well-funded competition.The decision by Digital, Xerox and Intel to create an open standard for the 10Mbps Ethernet technology was a significant factor, enabling a large collection of vendors to build interoperable products. The consequent adoption of this standard by the IEEE 802 committee and the release of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet LAN Standard took this industry alliance and pushed it firmly into the realm of an industry-wide standard. The consequent market competition ensured that products were keenly priced, and the wide range of vendors forced each vendor to strictly adhere to a common standard in order to ensure that their products inter-operated with others.The increasing volume of deployment also allowed manufacturers to achieve economies of scale, and at that point Ethernet had it made — it was faster, simpler, and cheaper than anything else around for local networks.Nothing stays stable for very long, and Ethernet moved on as well. The original Ethernet specification used thick coaxial cable and vampire tap transceivers that were pretty chunky to say the least. By 1985, the IEEE standardized 10Base2, a wiring scheme that used thinner, more flexible coaxial wire. From there, Ethernet moved to standard office cabling systems, and the IEEE standardized Ethernet over twisted pair (10BaseT) in September 1990.The twisted pair standard was also an outcome of a changing topology of Ethernet deployments. The original concept of Ethernet was a ‘snake’ coaxial cable, passing close to each workstation, and the station would use a drop cable to attach to this common cable spine. But it was increasingly impossible to squeeze every client onto a single cable segment, and there was interest in bothextensiondevices that allowed for larger Ethernet systems, and interest in altering the underlying local topology to use the emerging office structured cabling systems that used a star hub twisted pair wiring approach.The next evolutionary step was to expand the network beyond its design limits. The problem was the careful interdependence between maximal cable paths, maximal propagation times and minimal packet sizes.With repeaters, it was possible to build larger Ethernets, but collision detection was compromised if the length of the longest run was more than twice the minimum frame size. Upper-level reliable transport protocols, such as TCP, could repair these issues of undetected packet collisions, but if the application was based on simple datagrams, then the packet drop could pass undetected. Applications such as DNS over UDP, and undetected collisions forced a greater dependence on application-level timers and significantly slower performance.The response was to segment the Ethernet network into a number of distinct collision realms.Bridgeswere perhaps the first real change to the original Ethernet concept, as a bridge does not pass on collisions. Abridgepicks up Ethernet frames from one collision domain LAN, inspects the destination MAC address, and retransmits the frame on the other collision domain if the Mac address is known to be on the other domain.Bridges are essentiallytransparentdevices, in that when two stations communicate across a bridge there is no way that either station can discover that there is one or more intervening bridges. The packet format is unaltered by the bridge, and the bridge passes on all broadcast packets as well as all unicast packets.Of course, the real giveaway sign of the use of a bridge is increased latency. As a bridge reassembles the entire packet before switching it onto another LAN, there will always be a minimum latency of the packet size between any two stations.Concerns about the extended latencies encountered in large LANS lead to the interesting concept of early switching, where the switching decision was taken as soon as the destination MAC address was received, and the remainder of the packet was switched through at the wire rate. If the source packet encounters a collision, the collision will need to be reproduced on the destination LAN where the packet was already being transmitted.From this two-port model comes the notion of a multi-port bridge, and in a multi-port bridge, it’s possible to use an internal switching fabric that allows multiple packets to be switched between LAN interfaces in one switching cycle. This is the core of the LAN switch, where a number of individual LAN ports are interconnected via a switching fabric.The other development was the introduction of the full-duplex Ethernet architecture. This is still an Ethernet LAN, but in this case, there are only two stations. There are also two distinct communications channels, one allowing the first station to send frames to the second, and the other to allow frames to be sent in the opposite direction.Now one station’s transmissions do not interfere with the other, and there is now no LAN length restriction due to the need to enforce a collision restriction. Using this approach, it is possible to interconnect two LANs using a wide area serial link between two bridges, and arbitrarily complex topologies of LAN interconnections can be constructed. This collision-free full duplex architecture has been a cornerstone in extending the speed of Ethernet.But Ethernet is a very simple framing architecture, and the problem with setting up complex topologies is that it’s way too easy to set up various forms of loops. The Ethernet Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)  was a way to extend the ‘plug-and-play’ approach to complex bridged Ethernet topologies that allowed various forms of automated detection of link redundancy and fail-over from primary to secondary paths.Reliability?In the pressure to increase the range, speed and capacity of Ethernet, the architecture of reliability in packet transmission has been questioned. The design of the common bus architecture was intended to provide the sender with some level of assurance that the medium had delivered the packet to the intended receiver. What it did not do was provide any indication to the sender that the packet was processed by the receiver, and that it was successfully passed to the receiving process.If the concept of reliability in packet delivery is important, then it’s important to appreciate that the common bus CSMA/CD Ethernet cannot deliver all aspects of reliable packet delivery. If an application wants reliable data service, then it needs to use a reliable transport service, such as TCP.In general, it’s a role for the upper layers of the protocol stack to provide reliable delivery service, if that is what is desired by the application. In which case, what’s the point of Ethernet’s efforts to offer some partial reliability? If the entire intent of the collision avoidance measures was to increase the efficiency of the medium when using a common bus, then if you moved away from a common bus then did it make sense to do anything at all in terms of media level reliability? The answer to that question is ‘no’!Faster and fasterThe next evolution of Ethernet occurred in the early 1990s with the introduction of 100Mbps Ethernet.With the speed change came a change to the basic concept of how LANS are constructed. Remember that in the basic CSMA/CD common bus architecture of 10Mbps Ethernet, the maximum diameter of the LAN is half the size of the minimum packet.That is, if a transmitter is sending a minimum-sized packet, and at the other end of the LAN a transmitter also commences to send the instant before the leading bit of the original transmission reaches the new transmitter, then the collision response must reach the original sender before the entire packet is placed onto the wire. But if we up the speed by a factor of 10 and leave everything else the same, then LANS will shrink from a maximum diameter of 1,500m for a collision domain to around 150m.Of course, the other option is to increase the minimum and maximum packet sizes by a factor of 10, but this would represent a relatively inefficient tradeoff with many transport protocols, as well as having to implement some media-level frame fragmentation features to allow a large frame to be fragmented into a set of smaller frames if you want to interconnect a 100Mbps system to a 10Mbps system.The Ethernet design for 100Mbps started off with the objective of keeping a consistent packet format and packet size range and allowing all other parameters to adjust. While, in theory, this forces a common bus 100Mbps Ethernet into a relatively small maximum diameter, 100Mbps has been used with various forms of switching hubs, allowing a twisted pair run of 100m from the hub point to the station.With this speed step, we moved away from a single common bus and a collision framework into a set of serial links and Ethernet switches. We replaced the coaxial cable snake with hub and spoke structured wiring, which remain with us through to today.The next step was to a 1 Gigabit data rate, and again the frame size range of 46 to 1,500 bytes of data was preserved. Like the 10 and 100Mbps Ethernet specifications, a point-to-point connection can operate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode.The half-duplex mode of operation was problematic at this speed, as the network extent is reduced to some 15m at this speed, so the half-duplex version of Gigabit Ethernet supportscarrier extension, where the slot time is extended by a factor of 8-to-4,096-bit times. Coupled with this is the extension of ‘frame bursting’, allowing multiple short frames to be packed into a single contention interval in half-duplex mode. Full duplex gigabit Ethernet does not need such modifications and operates with the same 96-bit inter-frame spacing, the same Ethernet frame size range and the same frame format as the original 10Mbps CSMA/CD common bus Ethernet.And then came 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE). With this standard, the entire concept of half-duplex operation has been dropped, and with it any remnant of CSMA/CD.The 10GE specification originally applied to full-duplex mode, over fibre optic cables. There is no preamble to a frame at these rates, and instead, the link uses a carrier signal to keep the sender and receiver in sync.The industry stabilized on 10GE systems from the mid-1990s for the next 15 years. It reflected a slightly slower evolutionary path for increasing the data speeds in optical signal transmission systems and a somewhat lower level of intensity of customer interest in a significantly faster network performance at this time.40GE, 100GE, and beyondThe work on specifications of ever-faster Ethernet was not concentrated on changes to the Ethernet framing or access specification. The frame sizes were unaltered, as were most other aspects of Ethernet. This looked a lot like 10GE with a faster data clock.The concentration of effort was around the modulation of the photonic signal. Up to 10Gbs, it was possible to use simple on/off encoding and achieve acceptable transmission length over single-mode fibre cable. However, to lift the speed the optical designers turned to group coding, making use of phase shift keying, and also amplitude coding, similar to the earlier work on improving the speed of analogue modems in the telephone network.If the signal could be divided into 16 discrete points in the Fourier space, then each point corresponded to a selection of 1 in 16, or 4 bits. In effect, this allowed the optical designers to increase the number of bits per baud. The tradeoffs here include target distance, optical power, and fibre characteristics, so the effort was a balance of lifting the baud rate and increasing the number of discrete encoding points in Fourier space.There are a number of offerings in the market for 200GE and 400GE systems, and the standards work is underway in the IEEE for 800GE and 1.6TE. As with the earlier 10Ge to 100Ge transition, progress is expected to be paced rather than accelerated. The current level of pressing demand for such single-channel speeds exists at present only in the realm of the hyperscalers, such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft, while the larger mass of the industry is still coming to terms with a more gradual transition into the 100GE world.As we’ve seen in the evolution of fibre speeds, the critical path here sits within the evolution of Digital Signal Processors (DSP), where the achievable silicon track width determines the level of complexity and sensitivity of the DSP chip. We can get into the Tbps space using a base baud rate of 190Gbd on a fibre system using PCS-144QAM signal coding and DSPs built on a chip track width of 5nm. This is still at the leading edge of technology capability.The refinements of DSPs will continue, but we may see changes to the systems that inject the signal into the cable. In the same way that vectored DSL systems use pre-compensation of the injected signal in order to compensate for signal distortion in the copper loop, it may be possible to use pre-distortion in the laser drivers, in order to achieve even higher performance from these fibre cable systems.But is it Ethernet?What’s left of Ethernet in this forthcoming Terabit bit incarnation? At this point, we’ve reintroduced constant clocking in terms of a carrier signal, we’ve dispensed with CSMA/CD and returned to a full-duplex mode of operation. We’ve kept the range of frame sizes, and we’ve retained the 48-bit unique MAC address framework in a largely unaltered framing format. Perhaps we’re now down to the essential fundamentals of what makes a network design an instance of Ethernet.Despite what we may have thought at the time, Ethernet is not a CSMA/CD common bus LAN. Ethernet has turned out to be no more and no less than a global addressing scheme for devices that share a common framing format to transmit data.Maybe that’s enough.Happy birthday, Ethernet!Rate this articleThe views expressed by the authors of this blog are their own                                and do not necessarily reflect the views of APNIC.

      "CLI tools hidden in the Python standard library | Simon Willison’s TILsSimon Willison’s TILsCLI tools hidden in the Python standard librarySeth Michael Larsonpointed outthat the Pythongzipmodule can be used as a CLI tool like this:python -m gzip --decompress pypi.db.gzThis is a neat Python feature: modules with aif __name__ == \"__main__\":block that are available on Python's standard import path can be executed from the terminal usingpython -m name_of_module.Seth pointed out this is useful if you are on Windows and don't have thegziputility installed.This made me wonder: what other little tools are lurking in the Python standard library, available on any computer with a working Python installation?Finding them with ripgrepI decided to take a sniff around the standard library and see what I can find.Jim Crist-Harifpointed metopython -m site, which outputs useful information about your installation:python3.11 -m sitesys.path = [    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11',    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python311.zip',    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload',    '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages',    '/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages',]USER_BASE: '/Users/simon/Library/Python/3.11' (doesn't exist)USER_SITE: '/Users/simon/Library/Python/3.11/lib/python/site-packages' (doesn't exist)ENABLE_USER_SITE: TrueThis showed me that the standard library itself for my Homebrew installation of Python 3.11 is in/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11.So I switched there and usedripgrepto find likely packages:cd /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11Then ranrg:rg 'if __name__ =' -l | grep -v 'test/' \\  | grep -v 'tests/' | grep -v idlelib | grep -v turtledemoThe-loption causesripgrepto list matching files without showing the context of the match.I built up thosegrep -vexclusions over a few iterations -idlelib/andturtledemo/have a bunch of matches that I wasn't interested in.Here's the result:tabnanny.pypyclbr.pynetrc.pyheapq.pyfileinput.pysite.pytelnetlib.pysmtplib.pytimeit.py__hello__.pyaifc.pyjson/tool.pyasyncio/__main__.pyrunpy.pymailcap.pytokenize.pysmtpd.pysysconfig.pytarfile.pylib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.pylib2to3/pgen2/driver.pylib2to3/pgen2/literals.pyxmlrpc/server.pyxmlrpc/client.pygetopt.pydbm/__init__.pydoctest.pypickle.pyimaplib.pycompileall.pyshlex.pyast.pyvenv/__init__.pypy_compile.pyensurepip/__main__.pyensurepip/_uninstall.pyhttp/server.pypickletools.pypoplib.pyquopri.pycalendar.pypprint.pysymtable.pypstats.pyinspect.pypdb.pyplatform.pywsgiref/simple_server.pyrandom.pyftplib.pymimetypes.pyturtle.pytkinter/dialog.pyxml/sax/expatreader.pytkinter/colorchooser.pytkinter/dnd.pytkinter/filedialog.pytkinter/messagebox.pytkinter/simpledialog.pytkinter/font.pytkinter/scrolledtext.pyxml/sax/xmlreader.pytkinter/__init__.pycode.pydifflib.pypydoc.pyuu.pyimghdr.pyfilecmp.pyprofile.pycgi.pycodecs.pymodulefinder.py__phello__/__init__.py__phello__/spam.pymultiprocessing/spawn.pytextwrap.pybase64.pycurses/textpad.pycurses/has_key.pyzipapp.pycProfile.pydis.pywebbrowser.pynntplib.pysndhdr.pygzip.pyctypes/util.pyzipfile.pyencodings/rot_13.pydistutils/fancy_getopt.pyThat's a lot of neat little tools!I haven't explored my way through all of them yet, but runningpython -m module_nameusually outputs something useful, and adding-hfrequently provides help.A few highlightsHere are a few of the commands I've figured out so far.http.serverTo run a localhost webserver on port 8000, serving the content of the current directory:python -m http.serverThis takes an optional port.

      "Noticing when an app is only hosted in us-east-1 | JonLuca’s BlogJonLuca's BlogPostsAboutContactInteresting Snippets26 Jun 2023Noticing when an app is only hosted in us-east-1Every time I leave New York and land back in Europe or in Asia, I can immediately tell which apps have a global presence and which apps only deploy to a single US region. Everything just immediately feels a little slower. The pull to refresh feels a bit sluggish, the preview images take a little longer to load, and even native apps just feel less responsive.Floored LatencyThe speed of the experience you can offer your users is floored by a few variables, most notably the physical distance from the origin server to where the user is actually sitting.Us-east-1 (appropriately located right by “Centreville, Virginia”) is one of the main data centers run by AWS. If you’re a startup (or even quite a few mature companies), you are likely to deploy your application here. If you manage a stateful service, or your architecture doesn’t support distributed compute, you are likely toonlydeploy here. If you have users in Sydney, Australia, any network request you make will need to travel 15,677km to make it there, as the crow flies.Distance from Centreville, Virginia to Sydney, AustraliaIf you’re traveling at:1) The speed of light2) as the crow flies3) with no overheadthen that means that you areflooredat 104ms of latency for your request.Time in takes for the speed of light to travel from us-east-1 to SydneyAnd this is assuming no interference, other traffic, or time spent handling the request.In reality, the ping you’ll experience will be worse, at around 215ms (which is a pretty amazing feat in and of itself - all those factors above only double the time it takes to get from Sydney to the eastern US).Ping to various cities around the globeRealized latencyHaving spent so much time trying to optimize web pages and API responses for performance, I’ve gotten a pretty good internal model for latency. I can’t quite tell the difference between a us-east-1 server when I’m in New York versus San Francisco, but I can definitely tell if you’ve got an instance deployed ineu-central-1or not when I’m in Italy, orap-east-1when I’m in Sydney.Using a global CDN can help get your assets to your users quicker, and most companies by this point are using something like Cloudflare or Vercel, but many still only serve static or cached content this way. Very frequently the origin server will still be a centralized monolith deployed in only one location, or there will only be a single database cluster.As soon as you land back in the United States and turn of Airplane mode on your phone everything just starts feeling… snappier? A little more fluid? As much as T-Mobile and Verizon would like to take credit for that I don’t think theres much more to it than the physical location of the servers and where you are at that moment.JonLucaat 12:26To get notified when I publish a new essay,please subscribe here.\n",

      "OpenOrcaEric's CodeFollowEric's CodeFollowOpenOrcaEric Hartford·Jun 29, 2023·3min readToday I am announcing OpenOrca, an open-source dataset and series of instruct-tuned language models.As I readOrca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4by Mukherjee et. al. of Microsoft, I had to consider the implications for Open Source AI.This was pretty awesome stuff. But, I realized that while Microsoft would probably release their LLaMA-13b based model (as of the time of this writing they still haven't) I concluded that they might not release the dataset.Therefore, I resolved to replicate their efforts, download the data myself, and train the model myself, so that OpenOrca can be released on other sizes of LLaMA as well as other foundational models such as Falcon, OpenLLaMA, RedPajama, MPT, RWKV.This was a nontrivial undertaking. With the help of an all-star team of open-source AI/ML engineers, we have completed the OpenOrca dataset.Our dataset consists of:~1 million of FLANv2 augmented with GPT-4 completions~3.5 million of FLANv2 augmented with GPT-3.5 completionsWe followed the submix and system prompt distribution outlined in the Orca paper. With a few exceptions. We included all 75k of CoT in the FLAN-1m dataset rather than sampling that. Also, we found that many items were duplicated so we removed duplicates, resulting in 3.5m instructs in the ChatGPT dataset.We are presently performing full weights fine-tuning of OpenOrca on the foundation of LLaMA-13b, so that our performance can be compared with Microsoft's model when it releases.We expect to release OpenOrca-LLaMA-13b in mid-July 2023. At that time we will publish our evaluation findings and the dataset.We are currently seeking GPU compute sponsors for training OpenOrca on the following platforms:Falcon 7b, 40bLLaMA 7b, 13b, 33b, 65bMPT-7b, 30bAny other targets that get a sponsor. (RWKV, OpenLLaMA)From the Orca paper and our experiments, we roughly estimate the compute costs as follows:Model SizeCompute Estimate7b1k GPU-Hours13b2k GPU-Hours30/33b4k-6k GPU-Hours40b8k-10k GPU-Hours65b10k-15k GPU-HoursWe will share our appreciation for sponsorship in this space, as well as the model cards.Our current sponsors:Financial Contribution and mentorship -chirper.aiLLaMA 7b -preemo.ioLLaMA 33b -latitude.shPlease reach out to me if you are interested in providing compute sponsorship for any specific targets of OpenOrca.I would like to thank the motley crew of Open Source AI/ML engineers who have worked beside me in this endeavor.

      "Solving \"Two Sum\" in C with a tiny hash tableSolving \"Two Sum\" in C with a tiny hash tableJune 26, 2023nullprogram.com/blog/2023/06/26/I came across a question: How does one efficiently solveTwo Sumin C?There’s a naive quadratic time solution, but also an amortized linear timesolution using a hash table. Without a built-in or standard library hashtable, the latter sounds onerous. However, amask-step-index table,a hash table construction suitable for many problems, requires only a fewlines of code. This approach is useful even when a standard hash table isavailable, because byexploiting the known problem constraints, itbeats typical generic hash table performance by 1–2 orders of magnitude(demo).The Two Sum exercise, restated:Given an integer array and target, return the distinct indices of twoelements that sum to the target.In particular, the solution doesn’t find elements, but their indices. Theexercise also constrains input ranges — important but easy to overlook:2 <=count<= 104-109<=nums[i]<= 109-109<=target<= 109Notably, indices fit in a 16-bit integer with lots of room to spare. Infact, it will fit in a 14-bit address space (16,384) with still plenty ofoverhead. Elements fit in a signed 32-bit integer, and we can add andsubtract elements without overflow, if just barely. The last constraintisn’t redundant, but it’s not readily exploitable either.The naive solution is to linearly search the array for the complement.With nested loops, it’s obviously quadratic time. At 10k elements, weexpect an abysmal 25M comparisons on average.int16_tcount=...;int32_t*nums=...;for(int16_ti=0;i<count-1;i++){for(int16_tj=i+1;j<count;j++){if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){// found}}}Thenumsarray is “keyed” by index. It would be better to also have theinverse mapping: key on elements to obtain thenumsindex. Then for eachelement we could compute the complement and find its index, if any, usingthis second mapping.The input range is finite, so an inverse map is simple. Allocate an array,one element per integer in range, and store the index there. However, theinput range is 2 billion, and even with 16-bit indices that’s a 4GB array.Feasible on 64-bit hosts, but wasteful. The exercise is certainly designedto make it so. This array would be very sparse, at most less than half apercent of its elements populated. That’s a hint: Associative arrays arefar more appropriate for representing such sparse mappings. That is, ahash table.Using Go’s built-in hash table:funcTwoSumWithMap(nums[]int32,targetint32)(int,int,bool){seen:=make(map[int32]int16)fori,num:=rangenums{complement:=target-numifj,ok:=seen[complement];ok{returnint(j),i,true}seen[num]=int16(i)}return0,0,false}In essence, the hash table folds the sparse 2 billion element array onto asmaller array, with collision resolution when elements inevitably land inthe same slot. For this exercise, that small array could be as small as10,000 elements because that’s the most we’d ever need to track. Forfolding the large key space onto the smaller, we could use modulo. Forcollision resolution, we could keep walking the table.int16_tseen[10000]={0};// Find or insert nums[index].int16_tlookup(int32_t*nums,int16_tindex){inti=nums[index]%10000;for(;;){int16_tj=seen[i]-1;// unbiasif(j<0){// empty slotseen[i]=index+1;// insert biased indexreturn-1;}elseif(nums[j]==nums[index]){returnj;// match found}i=(i+1)%10000;// keep looking}}Take note of a few details:An empty slot is zero, and an empty table is a zero-initialized array.Since zero is a valid value, and all values are non-negative, it biasesvalues by 1 in the table.Thenumsarray is part of the table structure, necessary for lookups.The two mappings — element-by-index and index-by-element — sharestructure.It usesopen addressingwithlinear probing, and so walks the tableuntil it either either finds the element or hits an empty slot.The “hash” function is modulo. If inputs are not random, they’ll tendto bunch up in the table. Combined with linear probing makes for lotsof collisions. For the worst case, imagine sequentially ordered inputs.Sometimes the table will almost completely fill, and lookups will be nobetter than the linear scans of the naive solution.Most subtle of all: This hash table is not enough for the exercise. Thekeyed-on element may not even be innums, and when lookup fails, thatelement is not inserted in the table. Instead, a different element isinserted. The conventional solution has at least two hash tablelookups.In the Go code, it’sseen[complement]for lookups andseen[num]for inserts.To solve (4) we’ll use a hash function to more uniformly distributeelements in the table. We’ll also probe the table in a random-ish orderthat depends on the key. In practice there will be little bunching evenfor non-random inputs.To solve (5) we’ll use a larger table: 214or 16,384 elements.This has breathing room, and with a power of two we can use a fast maskinstead of a slow division (though in practice, compilers usuallyimplement division by a constant denominator with modular multiplication).To solve (6) we’ll key complements together under the same key. It looksfor the complement, but on failure it inserts the current element in theempty slot. In other words,this solution will only need a single hashtable lookup per element!Laying down some groundwork:typedefstruct{int16_ti,j;_Boolok;}TwoSum;TwoSumtwosum(int32_t*nums,int16_tcount,int32_ttarget){TwoSumr={0};int16_tseen[1<<14]={0};for(int16_tn=0;n<count;n++){// ...}returnr;}Theseenarray is a 32KiB hash table large enough for all inputs, smallenough that it can be a local variable. In the loop:int32_tcomplement=target-nums[n];int32_tkey=complement>nums[n]?complement:nums[n];uint32_thash=key*489183053u;unsignedmask=sizeof(seen)/sizeof(*seen)-1;unsignedstep=hash>>13|1;Compute the complement, then apply a “max” operation to derive a key. Anycommutative operation works, though obviously addition would be a poorchoice. XOR is similar enough to cause many collisions. Multiplicationworks well, and is probably better if the ternary produces a branch.The hash function is multiplication witha randomly-chosen prime.As we’ll see in a moment,stepwill also add-shift the hash before use.The initial index will be the bottom 14 bits of this hash. Forstep,recall from the MSI article that it must be odd so that every slot iseventually probed. I shift out 13 bits and then override the 14th bit, sostepeffectively skips over the 14 bits used for the initial tableindex.I usedunsignedbecause I don’t really care about the width of the hashtable index, but more importantly, I want defined overflow from all thebit twiddling, even in the face of implicit promotion. As a bonus, it canhelp in reasoning about indirection:seenindices areunsigned,numsindices areint16_t.for(unsignedi=hash;;){i=(i+step)&mask;int16_tj=seen[i]-1;// unbiasif(j<0){seen[i]=n+1;// bias and insertbreak;}elseif(nums[j]==complement){r.i=j;r.j=n;r.ok=1;returnr;}}The step is added before using the index the first time, helping toscatter the start point and reduce collisions. If it’s an empty slot,insert thecurrentelement, not the complement — which wouldn’t bepossible anyway. Unlike conventional solutions, this doesn’t requireanother hash and lookup. If it finds the complement, problem solved,otherwise keep going.Putting it all together, it’s only slightly longer than solutions using ageneric hash table:TwoSumtwosum(int32_t*nums,int16_tcount,int32_ttarget){TwoSumr={0};int16_tseen[1<<14]={0};for(int16_tn=0;n<count;n++){int32_tcomplement=target-nums[n];int32_tkey=complement>nums[n]?complement:nums[n];uint32_thash=key*489183053u;unsignedmask=sizeof(seen)/sizeof(*seen)-1;unsignedstep=hash>>13|1;for(unsignedi=hash;;){i=(i+step)&mask;int16_tj=seen[i]-1;// unbiasif(j<0){seen[i]=n+1;// bias and insertbreak;}elseif(nums[j]==complement){r.i=j;r.j=n;r.ok=1;returnr;}}}returnr;}Applying this technique to Go:funcTwoSumWithBespoke(nums[]int32,targetint32)(int,int,bool){varseen[1<<14]int16forn,num:=rangenums{complement:=target-numhash:=int(num*complement*489183053)mask:=len(seen)-1step:=hash>>13|1fori:=hash;;{i=(i+step)&maskj:=int(seen[i]-1)// unbiasifj<0{seen[i]=int16(n)+1// biasbreak}elseifnums[j]==complement{returnj,n,true}}}return0,0,false}With Go 1.20 this is an order of magnitude faster thanmap[int32]int16,which isn’t surprising. I used multiplication as the key operator because,in my first take, Go produced a branch for the “max” operation — at a 25%performance penalty on random inputs.A full-featured, generic hash table may be overkill for your problem, anda bit of hashed indexing with collision resolution over a small arraymight be sufficient. The problem constraints might open up such shortcuts.coptimizationHave a comment on this article?

      "Google is about to make life more difficult for custom ROM fansBest daily dealsAffiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission.Learn more.MobileGoogle is about to make life more difficult for custom ROM fansGoogle's decision to deprecate two key open-source apps could have ramifications for custom ROMs and upstart brands.ByHadlee Simons•June 14, 2023Joe Hindy / Android AuthorityTL;DRGoogle has quietly deprecated support for the Dialer and Messaging apps in AOSP.This means brands need to use their own apps or Google’s latest phone and messaging apps.This news could also be a blow to the custom ROM community.The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is the foundation of Android today, being an open-source version of the platform that’s maintained by Google. This version of Android also ships with a variety of open-source apps, but it turns out that Google is killing support for two of these apps.OS Newsnoticed that Google had deprecated support for the Dialer and Messaging apps in AOSP, and we were able to confirm this on the Android Code Search directory.Google left the following message for the Dialer and Messaging apps in the directory:This app is not actively supported and the source is only available as a reference. This project will be removed from the source manifest sometime in the future.The good news is that this shouldn’t affect the vast majority of consumers. Many brands either have their own phone and messaging apps or rely on Google’s newer, closed-source phone and Messages apps. However, this does mean upstart mobile brands can’t use the older, open-source apps. Instead, they’ll need to license Google’s new apps or invest in creating their own apps.What does this mean for Android tinkering?Google’s decision to deprecate the AOSP Dialer and Messaging apps is also a blow to the tinkering community.Custom ROMdevelopers might need to develop their own phone and texting apps or could be forced to use older versions of the AOSP apps. But sticking with these unsupported apps isn’t a long-term solution owing to security concerns and the fact that newer Android versions eventually won’t support them.The issue could also affect so-called Generic System Images (GSIs), which are basic versions of Android for testing and validation. GSIs are available with and without Google services, so it stands to reason that versions without Google support will eventually lack a phone and messaging app (or ship with older, unsupported versions).This news serves as perhaps further evidence of AOSP’s reduced significance, as Google seeks to tie more and more previously open-source features behind its own proprietary frameworks and services.We’ve contacted Google for confirmation of the changes and will update the article if/when the company gets back to us.NewsAOSPComments\n",

It slowed the conversation down enough so that we could both hear what was happening. (this is one of the reasons that cadence is an essential element ofmy Conversation OS Canvas)I could have just laughed along with the inside joke. Hah Hah, isn’t repressing trauma funny?!But my interest is always in taking a conversation deeper, to the heart of the matter.I asked her if I could offer an alternative perspective.Now, some folks will tell you that coaching is *never* ever about offering advice. But I knew how to pivot her understanding of an essential startup philosophy and learn to apply it to herself.Also, I’m her friend, and you can’t coach friends, right?In my defense, I asked for permission first. Key point. Advice without permission is...well, it sucks. (Invitation and Power are also key elements ofthe OS Canvas, just saying)See, this friend of mine has been starting up a company for the last few years. It’s taken off...they’ve been selling well, and getting some great placements, requiring bigger orders...which are complicated. Pricing a product depends on how much you are planning to make over time, the amounts you make may determine the manufacturing process. (This is, by the way, a physical product. They are, for lack of a better word, hard. (It’s a pun.))The uncertainty in demand was making it hard to price the product competitively. The difficulties in pricing were making it hard to negotiate with bigger buyers quickly. No one likes the phrase “negotiations were dragging on” ...but they were.On the call, she’d admitted to me that if today, she was handed her company, with all of its challenges, she’d be thrilled. She’d get right into problem-solving mode and knock ‘em down, one at a time, like the boss that she is.But most of these problems are ones that she’d created, herself. As she’d been explaining to me during our conversation, she had bootstrapped her company, launched the product as an MVP, and had been scrambling ever since to scale it properly, mostly by rebuilding it from the ground up. She had already shared with me how bootstrapping had created all of these challenges for her, and how she was being more intentional about building her product’s solid foundation.So I knew that the word “bootstrapped” meant something to her. She had been living it. And she knew all about how, eventually, you have to start over...sometimes from the ground up and (re)build a solid foundation.She just wasn’t using that language on herself. Nor had she realized that the emotional state of her company and her own emotional state were so intimately intertwined.I am a total bootstrapper, so I empathized. Maybe you are, too? I love to just get an idea out there and see what traction we can get. But that isouterbootstrapping.What she was doing wasinnerbootstrapping.A few years back, I wrote on a sticky note:“Don’t emotionally Bootstrap your Startup”.Since I wrote that sticky note I’ve done a lot to reduce my own inner-bootstrapping. I have a coach, I work with an executive coaching mastermind as I deepen my own executive coaching practice, I have a men’s group that meets weekly (it’s like crossfit for my emotions), a therapist and a slack channel filled with innovation consultants who are all more talented than me, and generous with their insights. And...yet...It can still feel lonely and hard sometimes.Some people will tell you that a coach can’t tell a personal story, or offer advice. In this case, I knew that sharing my sticky note and its back story with her would help her rethink her inner-bootstrapping mentality.When I shared this idea with her, I watched her shoulders lower an inch. She took a deep breath. She started to step back from being inside of her pattern to watching it from the outside. She felt seen.She could begin to ideate about what *she* could do, and wanted to do, to help herself put on her own oxygen mask.But this was just the start. Trauma takes time. So we got to a deeper question: How could she forgive herself for creating her problems?Self Empathy, or empathy for a past version of yourself, is a powerful tool. Having a conversation with your past self is possible. Having a conversation with your future self is possible too.In fact, that’s where we finally got to. What did her future self want from her? What path would get her towards meeting that version of herself?These are conversations worth leading with yourself and for others.Tagged:2021Newer PostResistance is InformationOlder PostThe Secret to Engaging people remotelyBack to TopBlogPodcastPowered bySquarespace\n",

      "The Quest for a ‘Simple’ Smartwatch | Ben GillbanksBinaryMoon HomeWritingProjectsToysAboutContact MeSearchThe Quest for a 'Simple' Smartwatch27 Jun 2023←Removing Google fontsCategoriesRandomMy trusty old smartwatch recently stopped working. It was a Garmin Vivomove HR, a minimal hybrid watch with regular watch hands and a tiny hidden screen that showed notifications and messages. It served me well for quite some time but unfortunately the hidden screen has stopped working and it would cost me as much to get it fixed as it would to buy a new one. So I decided to get a new one.Looking for a new watch all I really wanted was a simple replacement that had three main features:Phone notifications: so I don’t miss calls/ textsStep counting: so I can keep track of my daily activityA long battery life: so I don’t have to charge it every dayThat’s it! I don’t need apps, or advanced health tracking — just the basics.I feel like this should be a simple thing to find, I can’t be the only person looking for a nice quality smartwatch that keeps me updated without all the extra fluff. But apparently, I am. I’ve spent hours searching for a watch that meets my criteria, and I’ve come up empty-handed.When searching, I immediately dismissed all Apple and Samsung watches due to their high prices and short battery life. Although Fossil watches looked appealing, I came across multiple reviews mentioning issues with the watch face steaming up. Casio watches showed promise, but their limited notifications and unattractive styling didn’t meet my preferences for a more elegant design. While Argos offered a range of Sekonda watches that seemed promising, all the reviews indicated that the battery life fell short of the claimed specifications.After much consideration, I narrowed down my options to two watches: the Withings Scanwatch and another Garmin model. I was particularly drawn to the stylish appearance of the Withings, but it exceeded my desired budget, so I opted for a brand I was familiar with.Eventually I picked the Garmin Forerunner 55 — a watch that is primarily designed for runners. It fits my needs surprisingly well, and I am enjoying having it, but I had to disable a ton of fitness tracking features that I’ll never use just so that I could do the things I wanted. Plus I probably paid extra for all these extra features that I have switched off.Garmin Forerunner 55 Smartwatch. The screen shows the stress feature. I turned this off.At least the battery is good, it’s advertised as lasting 2 weeks, and shows signs of doing just that, possibly a bit longer.I’m aware that there are cheaper alternatives out there like the Amazfit range but these watches were either too complex, or too basic, there was no middle ground. Plus, call me picky if you like, but having a reputable brand name behind my purchase gives me extra peace of mind when it comes to reliability.Speaking of unexpected discoveries during this whole quest of mine — there’s one feature on my new watch that I hadn’t considered before: custom watch faces. They are more fun than I expected; although I have plumped for a minimal design with just the time and date on it. I’m actually tempted to try creating my own watch face design, but that’s a project for another day.Maybe one day companies will realize there is a market for straightforward smartwatches and provide us with something a bit simpler, or maybe they won’t and I’ll have to keep on using these all singing all dancing ones. Or maybe we will all end up plugging into the Matrix (or Apple Vision Pro) and won’t need watches any more anyway.

      "Writing Python like Rust · Questions Nobody Asked..Answering questions that nobody askedHomeAboutDownloadGitHub projectCurrently v0.1© 2022. All rights reserved.Questions Nobody Asked..Writing Python like Rust10 May 2020Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the type annotations.Listen, I didn’t plan on making a whole‘writing X like Y’series. But here we are.I’ve recently been working on a new project at work - my first project in pure Python 3. Meaning, I get to play with all the new toys!And as I was writing this code, it struck me that was borrowing a lot of tricks from Rust (and a little Go).TypesOne thing I’ve really gotten into in Python 3 istype annotations.The format is quite like Rustdefrepeat(text:str,number:int)->str:...fnrepeat(text:&str,number:usize)->&str{...}(casually ignoring lifetimes)Unlike in a strongly typed language, the python type annotations aren’t enforced. You run a static checker likemypy, which is kind of like a compile-time check. But there’s no guarantee when the code is run, that the type annotations will be respected (by external code).Still, I’ve found that type checking has caught some potentially dumb bugs. In particular, it’s good at catchingOptionals, where I haven’t checked/dealt with the case where the value might beNone. That’s one thing I could get sloppy about in python 2 (“it probably won’t be None in practice”)StructsRust and Go (and C) don’t have objects, in the traditional sense. Instead, they have structs.Structs are basically containers for a collection of values.The biggest roadblock to doing something like structs in python was all the boilerplate. Bu this has been greatly simplified by introduction ofdataclassesDataclasses were officially added in python 3.7, but is available in earlier version via abackport. There’s alsoattrs, which does basically the same thing.Much like structs in Rust and Go, you declare your dataclass with its fields and the types of those fields@dataclassclassEvent:id:strtype:EventTypetimestamp:datetimeuser:strAll the other stuff like the__init__method, getters, setters, string formatter, etc. are generated for you.Of course, one advantage Python has over Rust in this case is being able to give fields default values.Traits/InterfacesTraits and interfaces define behaviours. The python equivalent isProtocols.These were officially introduced in python 3.8, so for earlier versions you’ll need thetyping_extensionsbackport.classReader(Protocol):defread(self,size:int=-1)->str:...defprint_contents(r:Reader):print(r.read())withopen('example.txt','r')asf:print_contents(f)In the above, the open file instance doesn’t explicitly sub-class theReaderclass, but because it implements areadmethod which matches the protocol, it passes type checking.In this sense, Protocols are more like Go than Rust. In Rust, you have to explicitlyimpl Trait for Struct, where as in python and Go it’s implicit.Errors and ResultsWhat I like about the Rust (and to a lesser extent, Go) approach to error handling is, you know up front if and what errors a function might return. And additionally, the compiler forces you to at least consider how you’re going to deal with it.By comparison, the python approach to dealing with exceptions is quite chunkytry:function()exceptSomeException:# etcI think this, in fact, encourages just letting exceptions bubble up, rather than fussing about with handling them.(Of course, if you’re the sort of person who deals with errors in rust by just slapping?on anything that might fail, then you’re more or less just doing exceptions)There is a 3rd party library -returns- that lets you do Rust-styleResulttypes. But that approach is quite ‘unpythonic’.In spite of the topic of this blog, I think you should always aim to write code which is idiomatic to the language you’re using. If only so it’s accessible to whoever has to maintain your code after you’re gone.Odds and EndsPython 3.4 introducesenumsinto the standard library. But these only support primitive types (ints, strings) - sort of like C or Java.One thing I miss from Rust is its ‘richer’enums, and pattern matching - what the functional programmers would callsum typesI did find a 3rd party library forsumtypes. I’m on the fence about whether this is pythonic. Also, I’d like to see a version usingdataclasses, rather thanattrspathlibis a revelation. Way more pleasant than working with strings andos.path. And functionally, it’s quite similar to rustPathRust doesiteratorsas chains, e.g.numbers.iter().filter(|x|x%2==0).map(|x|x+1).sum()And there are 3rd party libraries, likeiterchainthat will let you do the same sort of thing in python. But again, this isn’t really ‘pythonic’; the ‘most’ idiomatic way would be with list comprehensionsum(x+1forxinnumbersifx%2==0)ConclusionAt this point, you’re maybe wondering why we didn’t just write the project in Rust?Maybe if the python version goes down well, we’ll get an opportunity to, as the kids say, ‘rewrite it in rust’.Chris[By the transitive property, can we write bash scripts like rust..?]Related PostsWhen a Random Sample is as Good as the Whole Thing28 Oct 2022A Data Structure for Pokemon Cards28 May 2022Advent of Code 2021, Day 1 in 52 Chars of AWK02 Dec 2021\n",

We also fine tune the models on public-domain instructional data. The main take-aways are:On standard NLP benchmarks, XGen achieves comparable or better results when compared with state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (e.g. MPT, Falcon, LLaMA, Redpajama, OpenLLaMA) of similar model size.Our targeted evaluation on long sequence modeling benchmarks show benefits of our 8K-seq models over 2K- and 4K-seq models.XGen-7B archives equally strong results both in text (e.g., MMLU, QA) and code (HumanEval) tasks.Training cost of $150K on 1T tokens under Google Cloud pricing for TPU-v4.Codebase:https://github.com/salesforce/xGenModel Checkpoint:https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/xgen-7b-8k-baseWhy XGen-7B with 8K Sequence LengthAs LLMs become ubiquitous, their applications to long sequences have been a key focus, especially for applications like summarizing text (potentially interleaved with other data sources like tables and images), writing code, and predicting protein sequences, which require the model to effectively consider long distance structural dependencies. A large context allows a pre-trained LLM to look at customer data (e.g., documents the LLM did not use in training) and responds to useful information seeking queries.Yet, most open-source LLMs (e.g.,LLaMA,MPT,Falcon) have been trained with a maximum of 2K token sequence length, which is a key limitation in modeling long sequences. Inference time solutions such asALiBihave yet to be evaluated for larger models (e.g.MPT-7b-StoryWriter-65k+). Recentworkon model scaling has shown that for a given compute budget, the best performances are not necessarily achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data (measured by number of tokens). A smaller model is also generally preferred for inference efficiency during serving including on-device serving. In light of this, we train a series of 7B LLMs named XGen with standard dense attention on up to 8K sequence length for up to 1.5T tokens. We also fine tune the XGen models on public-domain instructional data, creating their instruction-tuned counterparts (XGen-7B-inst).ModelDescriptionXGen-7B-4K-baseWe train for 800B tokens with a sequence length of 2k tokens first, then for another 400B tokens (total1.2T tokens) with 4k.

(%)Data mentioned above5550%BigCode Starcoder5550%We useOpenAI’s tiktokento tokenize our data. We add additional tokens for consecutive whitespaces and tabs, as well as the special tokens described in theStarcoder paper.Training DetailsThe XGen-7b models are trained with our in-house library JaxFormer, which facilitates efficient training of LLMs under both data and model parallelism optimized for TPU-v4 hardware. The training recipe and model architecture follow LLaMA, while we conduct two additional explorations. First, we investigate the occurrence of so-called “loss spikes” [PaLM,loss spikes] during training, that is, the loss suddenly explodes temporarily while the root cause for these spikes is unknown. Second, the XGen models support sequence lengths up to 8,192 tokens (rather than the common 2,048) for which we introduce stage-wise training.Loss SpikesAs models are scaled to larger sizes, the training itself is increasingly sensitive to instabilities, which cause poor model performance, if not addressed carefully. In our exploration, we have gathered evidence for several factors, which individually contribute to unstable training. These preliminary findings include “sequential over parallel circuits”, “swish-GLU over GeLU”, “RMS-Norm over Layer-norm”. Specifically, widely used parallel circuits, which parallelize the computation of self-attention and feed-forward as adopted in [GPT-J,PaLM,CodeGen] may affect the stability of training.The figure above displays the loss in terms of cross-entropy over time following the well-known scaling laws. Remarkably, the training does not suffer from any instabilities or loss spikes. The two loss spikes depicted in the figure are expected when extending the sequence length, say from 2k to 4k tokens, since the model needs to adapt to such longer sequences.Sequence LengthTraining with longer sequences is computationally unproportionally costly as the complexity of self-attention is quadratic, that is, the training process is slow. To mitigate slow training, we introduce training in stages with increasing sequence length. First, 800B tokens with sequence length of 2k tokens are observed, then 400B tokens with 4k, finally, 300B tokens with 8k length.We verify the adaptation to longer sequences by computing the average perplexity at each token position on a held-out validation set containing documents of 8k sequence length or above. If the model successfully learns to utilize the full sequence, we would expect the perplexity to decrease over sequence length, as previous tokens carry information for the next to-be-predicted token. That is, for a long sentence, the more context in the form of previous words is provided, the easier it becomes to guess the next word. The figure above indeed shows that XGen at each stage successfully learns to utilize longer contexts, up to 8k sequence length.Results on Standard Benchmarks(i) MMLUWe first consider the Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark (see exampleshere), which is more recent than others due to which it is arguably less susceptible to data contamination as reported in recent studies (see page 32 ofGPT-4 paperand a related discussionhere), and has been used consistently as a held-out evaluation benchmark. Recently, however, inconsistencies in reporting MMLU scores have been reported, which resulted in wrong rankings in Hugginface’sOpen LLM leaderboard; In fact, Huggingface later had to write ablogto clarify this. In our work, we follow the original MMLU standard, which is consistent with the published results (i.e., in LLaMA).MMLU 5-shot In-context Learning Results:We first show results on the original (and recommended) 5-shot evaluation setting, where the LLM is provided with 5 demonstrations.

All these tasks benefit from using processing and understanding a long context to generate a correct response. Note that for these tasks most of thebasepre-trainedmodels failed to generate a plausible response because of the task difficulty. We thus use instruction-tuned models.DialogueTo assess the long dialogue understanding and summarization capabilities, we report results on three dialogue summarization tasks:AMI meeting summarization, ForeverDreaming (FD), and TVMegaSite (TMS)screenplay summarization. The average source lengths of these datasets are approximately 5570, 6466, and 7653, respectively. We specifically evaluate samples that are less than 8K in length using various instruction-tuned models. Notably, when input truncation was not applied, both MPT-7b-inst and Alpaca-inst failed to perform well in this setting.

We ask ChatGPT to generate questions from (a) long Wikipedia documents spanning four domains: Physics, Engineering, History, and Entertainment, and (b) summaries of these documents.  Then we query the LLMs to generate answers for these questions. The answers are typically up to 256 tokens long. We use GPT-4 to evaluate the answer quality in terms of coherence (structure and organization) and relevance (relevance of generated answer to the question and the context document) on a scale of 0-3.

Why do vaporwave tracks, albums, and artist names use stretched out ｆｕｌｌｗｉｄｔｈ text, Japanese writing 変, and 𐒖Ƭᖇ𝚫ƝǤⵟ looking Unicode characters? Why are track titles sometimes formatted to look like FILENAME.AVI or Muzak Corp™ Song Title?Analyzing the text characters that accompany vaporwave can help us understand vaporwave a whole. How so? In her book \"Because Internet\", linguist Gretchen McCulloch compares the challenges of analyzing speech at scale, with the ease of analyzing internet writing. Speech requires time and resources to decipher and process. Internet language, on the other hand, is easier to work with. Because text on the internet is public and digitized, McCulloch says it readily \"brings new insight to classic linguistic questions\".The same logic applies to vaporwave. Whilescholars,podcasters,YouTubers, andmusic fanshave worked to decipher vaporwave's sounds and images... we will focus on the text.We've analyzed the text that accompanies more than 800,000 vaporwave tracks, from 2010 to present day. We've scraped track titles, album titles, artists names, and metadata from SoundCloud and Bandcamp; to learn how how vaporwave came to be, how the aesthetic has evolved, and where its headed next.We have a YouTube video exploring many of the same ideas in this article.

It is sometimes viewed as a meme, sometimes doused in irony, and sometimes interpreted as a seriouscritique of capitalism. It can be all of (ornoneof) these things.The music of vaporwave samples sounds from the 80s and 90s; and processes them to sound like they're coming from degraded VHS tapes, from distant shopping malls, and from fading memories. Pop songs, ad jingles, weather channel muzak, and corporate training materials are slowed-down, distorted, drenched in reverb, and layered alongside warbly synths and flutters of dissonance, leaving the listener with analmostwarm-fuzzy feeling.The visual art associated with vaporwave intertwines vintage computer graphics, pop culture references, pink and teal gradients, classic video games, hazy skylines, all too-perfect shopping mall interiors, late night 1980s television ads, corporate jargon, Greek busts, and Japanese. Often, these elements are filtered and glitched, appearing as relics from a future we dreamed of -- before that dream faded from memory.The vaporwave aesthetic extends beyond the music, the album covers, and the music videos... to the text itself.Vaporwave text is a strange poetry. Artist names, album titles, track titles, and bios contain text that serves to amplify many of the feelings that vaporwave music and visual art draw out of us.Through text, the same feelings of nostalgia, lost futures, and decay can be achieved. This is done using rare Unicode characters, emojis, and strings of text that are broken and beautiful.Some vaporwave tracks titles likeOkinawa Sunset,Ocean Beach Highschool Prom 1984,Condominium Living, andWe Apologise For The Inconveniencedon't employ any text sorcery at all. They simply pair written word with recorded sounds to elicit feelings of lost futures, dream states, and nostalgia.With other track titles, the text itself appears glitched, degraded, and echoed. Track titles like沙灘 m i A M i // h–Or/r.erare unsettling in part because they are unpronounceable and can't readily be typed from memory. A track with a title like that can pop up on shuffle, worm its way into our ears, and then just disappear forever.According toScientific American\"Many people find they can't read text in dreams. If they see text, it's almost always garbled or hieroglyphics or doesn't make sense or it's fuzzy.\" Track names likeマRイ·EハTートUをR返Nすelicit those same dreamlike feelings through the breakdown of language.In the charts below, we can see vaporwave's trajectory through time. We see the growth and decline in track releases on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, interest from Google search volume, and active community engagement based on Reddit post count.These charts only tell part of vaporwave's story. In this article, we will analyze vaporwave's tapestry of letters, squiggles, shapes, and other Unicode characters. Like the music itself, the use of these text characters has changed over time.As we dissect the text used in vaporwave, we can gain greater insight into movement's origins and how it is mutating.But first, in order to understand how these text characters are rendered, we must understand Unicode...What is Unicode?Unicode is a text encoding standard. Unicode's goal is to assign every letter, number, and symbol in every language in the universe a uniquecode. Unicode is the de-facto system that computers use for encoding and representing text. There are currently 149,186 different Unicode characters in existence. For example: the code for lowercase \"v\" isU+0076, the code for the sunglasses emoji 😎 isU+1F60E, and the code for the infinity symbol ∞ isU+221E.These codes are organized into categories called Unicodeblocks. The letter \"v\" is in the \"Basic Latin\" block, the sunglasses emoji is in the \"Emoticons\" block, and the infinity symbol is in the \"Mathematical Operators\" block.Vaporwave ❤️ Unicode textWhile track titles in other musical genres mostly use the \"Basic Latin\" Unicode block (for English and European language song titles), vaporwave is different. Most vaporwave tracks do contain English language letters, but they exist alongside characters from many other blocks.Aside from Basic Latin, vaporwave tracks make heavy use of CJK (Chinese, Japanese, & Korean) characters, halfwidth and fullwidth forms, and characters from a plethora of other blocks.Here are some examples of track titles that use vaporwave's most common Unicode block combination: Basic Latin, CJK characters, and fullwidth / halfwidth characters.Ｎｏ Ｈａｒｄ Ｆｅｅｌｉｎｇｓ// 美的 Deluxe EditionＴＵＲＩＮＧ機械Anri - Remember Summer Days (マクロスMACROSS 82 - 99 Bootleg)ストレートＷｉｎｄｏｗｓからミックWhy do vaporwave tracks use characters from so many unusual blocks? Why are CJK and fullwidth characters used so frequently? Great questions. Read on...Compared to synthwaveIn our analysis, it's useful to compare vaporwave to its closest musical cousin, synthwave. Musicians will often straddle vaporwave and synthwave designations, and the sounds of these two genres sometimes overlap. Though their borders are blurry, vaporwave and synthwave are very different.The Aesthetics Wikinotes, while \"vaporwave can tend to have a more tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic tone to it, synthwave is incredibly earnest with its love of everything 80s and is made in tribute to the era rather than critiquing it.\"Here, Reddit userYutoob12explains the difference:Vaporwave is generally lighter colors, old computers, capitalism and greco roman statues. Synthwave is more neon, dark, sports cars, and tron grids.Reddit usergronkedescribes the distinction as follows:Synthwave is designed to emulate classic 80s themes and has an aesthetic of fast cars, faster women, and Miami sunsets. Vaporwave is totally different. It's more of a sarcastic cynical take on commercialized elements of the 90s. There are samples of jingles and pop culture clips. The music is designed to evoke a sense of familiarity with that time but in a more nightmarish sense.The difference between vaporwave and synthwave isn't only noticeable in the music and on album covers. The difference can also be spotted in each genre's use of Unicode text.About 25% of vaporwave tracks produced between 2012 and 2017 contain non-Latin characters in their titles. In more recent years, this number has decreased a little, hovering between 10% and 20%. Compare this to synthwave, where only a small fraction, about 5%, of track titles contain text that isn't from the Latin Unicode block.Synthwave uses fewer fullwidth and CJK Unicode characters. The most common blocks found in synthwave, after Basic Latin, are Latin-1 Supplement, and Cyrillic.As you might have guessed, synthwave tracks are also less likely to mix-and-match characters from multiple Unicode blocks. 95% of synthwave track titles use characters from only a single Unicode Block (usually Basic Latin). Compare that to vaporwave, where more than 15% of song titles use Unicode characters from at least two different Unicode blocks.While few vaporwave tracks use characters from more than 6 different Unicode blocks, they do exist. Here are some song titles where a higher than average number of distinct Unicode blocks are used:Track TitleBlocks / Characters12.

In the 80s and 90s, the decades that most influenced vaporwave, there was no single prevailing text encoding standard.To understand how the absence of the Unicode standard relates to vaporwave, let's briefly digress, and talk about Windows 95.Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system makes countless appearances in vaporwave. Itsstartup soundis famouslysampledon Blank Banshee 0, an album that Fader magazinecalleda \"definitive [document] of the vaporwave era\".There are namesake albums like♣ Windows 95 ♣by VIRTUALファンクに近いです andOverton Windows 95by Datavoid. The operating system's user interfaces and logo appear across a swath of album covers includingHIRAETHby 猫 シ Corp.,Virtual Dreamsby Virtualsoft Home, and the post-vaporwave / post-irony albumWelcome to Ｗ​ｉ​ｎ​ｄ​ｏ​ｗ​ｓ ９５ ya c---by ĐΔŇ.There are vaporwave artists who go by the non-existentWindows96and the OS's successorWindows 98のご紹介. The Windows 95 logo is even incorporated into thefeatured imageon the vaporwave Wikipedia page.Why is Windows 95 so present in vaporwave? Reddit userWarpCrow, credits \"the dated corporate aesthetic\" and Microsoft's \"idealistic marketing\". According toForbes magazine, Windows 95 was \"the most important operating system of all time [...] Compared to its predecessor, Windows 3.1, it was like using something from the future.\"So... did Windows 95, the darling OS of vaporwave, support Unicode? The answer isno. Windows 95 used ANSI encodings.The Apple IIGS used ASCII. Mac computers, prior to OSX, used an encoding based on ASCII called Mac OS Roman. Meanwhile in Japan, text was encoded with the JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, or Shift JIS standards. The default character set for older versions HTML was ISO-8859.... and so on... All of these technologies eventually adopted Unicode, but not before things got messy.When the MP3 gained popularity in the 90s, music wasn't accessed from centralized organized repositories like the iTunes Music Store or Spotify. Instead music was ripped, uploaded, tagged, downloaded, and burned to CD over and over -- across systems with no agreed upon text encoding standard. Garbled text (akamojibake) was a common occurrence.Some vaporwave text appears to be glitchy and badly encoded on purpose, playing into themes of both nostalgia and decay; transporting the listener back to the days of Limewire, Napster, and Winamp; to the days of sitting in a college dorm room, manually, painstaking organizing ID3 tags and wondering why the hell you've got MP3s that say \"Guns nâ€™ Roses\" and \"BjÃ¶ork\".Here are some track titles that purposely look likecommon text encoding problems. Be warned, some of these tracks are a little post-vaporwave and even veer into the harsh noise genre.ÅÅåÅåÅÅÃÃ¾ÂºÂ¾^@^@^@2^@áOV═Å«╜lL}∩3╙zR.2eVí@æxëğŸƒ¤ â–’ ğŸ˜â™ ğŸ—„•â Žß{†Þu|🎳​╩​⌐​eb​╣​y​÷​💭​g​☻​â\u0000​Σ​‼​é​╨​ⁿ​o🎲Â¨„‡Æ• „‚‡Æ (≠†§•¶§† ≠† °„§„È••)ãêäǿĩîãǿìã ▓▓ĩĩãáĩĩãĩãĩ██ʉêĩãêʉãêĩʉ████████Among all the pre-Unicode text encoding standards, the Japanese ones had the greatest impact on vaporwave. Text characters from standards like Shift JIS were eventually assigned their own Unicode blocks. Today, vaporwave artists rely heavily on these blocks. Why is this? Why does Japanese text encoding appear to be so prevalent in vaporwave text?Japan's impact on vaporwave 音楽In the 1980s, Japanese companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Honda were becoming dominant players in the global market. This led to a sense of admiration and respect for Japanese innovation. When we wax nostalgic about the the cars, TVs, VHS players, camcorders, computers, and video game systems of the 80s, the influence of Japanese technology cannot be overstated.The technology that came out of Japan in the 80s made a lasting impact on music and culture worldwide. TheRoland TR-808drum machine, which helped spawn hip-hop, techno, and house music, was invented in Japan in 1980.The Sony Discman, the world's first portable CD player, was invented in Japan in 1984. This was preceded by Sony's Walkman, invented in Japan in 1979. According toPitchfork, the Walkman \"had astounded the world. The combination of musical immersion and unlimited mobility was a genuinely new experience.\"For music collectors, CDs produced in Japan were (and still are!) rare and coveted. Japanese imports often contain unique artwork, packaging, and bonus tracks. In the 80s and 90s, when record stores were at their height of popularity, flipping through rows of compact discs and encountering an unusual (and expensive) Japanese import left an impression.Aside from Japanese technology, consumer tech imported from other Asian countries left its mark on American culture as well. While thefirstboombox was invented by the Dutch brand Philips, the Dutch didn't produce the boomboxes that seeped their way into hip-hop videos, nor did they produce the boombox that John Cusack held over his head, playing Peter Gabriel's \"In Your Eyes\", to win over the girl of his dreams in the 1989 filmSay Anything.John Cusack's boombox was a Japanese-made Toshiba RT-SX1. Of the 3 boomboxes in the Smithsonian Institute's collection, one is Japanese (aSharp HK-9000owned by Fab 5 Freddy) and two are Korean-made (Tecsonic boomboxes, one owned byPublic Enemyand one carried byRadio Raheemin the 1989 film Do the Right Thing).Japanese text plays into a nostalgia for the 80s and 90s. When paired with vaporwave's sounds, Japanese text can transport the listener to a time when \"Japan appeared to be the country that was building the future, one that looked shiny, new, and full of promise\".Is vaporwave racist?The discussion about whether vaporwave is guilty of cultural appropriation (or worse) is vast. According to Bandcamp's blog, \"vaporwave’s dependence on Asian characters can be seen as coming dangerously close to fetishizing the Other\".On a Reddit thread that asks \"is vaporwave racist?\", a verythought-out commentargues, \"maybe, but vaporwave is definitely Orientalist\". In other words, while vaporwave may not imply beliefs about racial superiority/inferiority, it does reinforces stereotypes and prejudices.In the Journal of the Cultural Studies Association, author Lucy March writes that even if presented in a satirical manner, vaporwave could be responsible for \"perpetuat[ing] harmful stereotypes\" especially in regard to the objectification of Asian women through pleasing aesthetics.What of the text ｔｈａｔ ｌｏｏｋｓ ｌｉｋｅ ｔｈｉｓ? Why does it so often accompany CJK characters in vaporwave? How does this fullwidth text relate to Japan? Does it also trigger nostalgia for lost futures?Japanese halfwidth and fullwidth formsTo make the leap from John Cusack's Japanese boombox, to the unusually wide English letters found in track titles likeＭｉｄｎｉｇｈｔ ｏｎ Ｍａｉｎ Ｓｔｒｅｅｔ,国内ＶＩＤＥＯｓｈｏｗｃａｓｅ,ｎｅｗ ｒｏｍａｎｔｉｃ ｓｔｒｅａｍｓ,ｆｒｅｓｈ ｓｉｐ // 新 鮮 な 一 口, and１９９２ - 空腹の目, we need to learn a little more about Japanese text encoding.These stretched out English letters are called fullwidth and halfwidth characters. They have been around since theJIS X 0201text encoding standard was introduced in 1969. This text encoding standard included 96 Japanese katakana characters, and 96 ASCII-like characters including English uppercase and lowercase letters.These 96 English letters were designed to use the same amount of horizontal width as the katakana letters, to achieve visual consistency and readability alongside their Japanese counterparts.Fullwidth characters were used alongside Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters, in print and digital media long before Unicode. In 1991, when the Unicode standard was created, these extra-wide letters were given their own Unicode block; known as \"Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms\".While fullwidth and halfwidth characters in vaporwave are often associated with Japanese, they also appear to have taken on a life of their own.65% of vaporwave track titles with fullwidth characters, are not accompanied by any CJK characters at all.While the origins of spaced out letters are tied to CJK characters, stretched out letter spacing in vaporwave can also have connotations unrelated to Japan. Fullwidth can be tied directly to vaporwave's sounds, and the emotions that the music elicits.Users in the r/vaporwave Reddit community have noted:The use of spaces is meant to signify an alteration of intonation and emphasis. It means \"I LIKE how this makes me feel\" -reddit userI would say the spaces represent the chopping up and slowing down of the samples used to make these songs. -reddit user abserstaI am pretty sure it's gotta do with the aesthetics of the earliest vaporwave songs in which they were stretched out and very reverb heavy. -reddit user AwesomeYearsA lot of vaporwave songs like to sample old elevator music, and timestretch it to make the tempo A L O T S L O W E R. -reddit user yepimthetoasterThe kerning could just be a result of the way the word is spoken, like a slow, distant, reverb-dripping whisper. -reddit use BrknTrnsmsnFullwidth text has become so entangled in vaporwave, that the word ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ itself, especially when written out in fullwidth characters, has an entirely different meaning. According toknowyourmeme, the word, when stylized in fullwidth characters is \"a term that refers to retro-inspired visual art and music associated with the vaporwave subculture\".A quick aside on language, grammar, and Unicode correctnessYou can ignore the peopleshakingtheirfistsatthesky-- \"aesthetic\"canbe an adjective, can be a synonym for vaporwave, can refer to vaporwave's aesthetic, or can refer to things that are simply beautiful. That sunset can bestraight aesthetic.Linguist, David Crystalsaid\"Language has no independent existence apart from the people who use it. It is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end of understanding [society].\"If the rules for language bubble up from the people who use it, then so too, do the rules for Unicode. Fullwidth characters don't need to be used to accompany Japanese characters. And, 𝞛𝝙𝝉𝕙𝜀𝓂𝝰𝜯𝝸⊂∡ℓ characters don't need to be used for solving math problems. 🎤💥Beyond fullwidthSome vaporwave track titles don't use characters from the fullwidth Unicode block to achieve the stretched-out look. Instead they use regular Latin characters with spaces between them, to mimic the the fullwidth aesthetic.In our analysis, we can spot these tracks by looking for text strings where close to 50% of the characters are spaces.char countletter countspace countpercent spacesdoes this look like fullwidth292544/29*100 = 13.7%d o e s  t h i s  l o o k  l i k e  f u l l w i d t h53252828/53*100 = 52.8%The graph below highlights the use of spaces in vaporwave and synthwave track titles. We can see the bump in vaporwave track titles that contain ~50% spaces. These are the tracks that mimic the aesthetic of fullwidth characters, but using only Latin characters.The trend of using extra space characters to mimic fullwidth isn't super common. It peaked in 2017, but is still in use.Looking athowvaporwave artists use extra spacing is more interesting than looking atwhenin vaporwave's history the trend came about. Some vaporwave tracks push the creative boundaries of letter spacing much further. In our analysis, we found tracks that go to extremes, containing almost 90% spaces.Unfortunately, this creative spacing doesn't render consistently across apps and browsers. As seen in the screenshot below, the Soundcloud mobile appdoesrender the letter spacing in \"SATURDAY MORNING\" as the artist intended.However... in web browsers, this spacing of the letters doesn't have the desired effect. This is becauseHTML ignores extra whitespaceplaced between words.In order for this text to render properly in the browser, regular Unicode space charactersU+0020would need to be replaced with non-breaking space (aka nbsp) charactersU+00A0. This is easier said than done. On the web, Soundcloud sanitizes nbsp characters, converting them into regular spaces. W o m p . W o m p .༗ It's evident that fullwidth is no longer just being utilized in its original intended manner. Over time, the stretched-out letter aesthetic has evolved. While we wait for web browsers to catch up with the ways vaporwave art pushes the limits of Unicode text, we can only wonder, what's next‽ In the meantime, there are many other ways that vaporwave artists use text to unsettle us, evoke our nostalgias, and lose us in the vapor.Corporate offices, malls, and the nostalgia factories™Vaporwave's relationship with nostalgia is complex. Much of vaporwave engages with nostalgia directly, by simply sampling sounds and images produced in the 80s and 90s. This includes sounds and images produced not by artists, but by corporations; sounds that filled ordinary and unremarkable moments of the past with elevator music, weather channel jazz, and TV jingles.Some vaporwave stops here, toying with our memories of the sounds in the background. Some vaporwave goes further though, commenting on how modern corporations also utilize nostalgia.Today, corporations intertwine feelings for yesterday with sales messages, weaponizing nostalgia. Even the biggest of anti-capitalist skeptics is not immune to getting \"the feels\" from a well-crafted Superbowl ad. Baked into vaporwave art, is the recognition that nostalgia is a product, and that corporations are some of nostalgia's finest, most manipulative, craftsmen.We can hear vaporwave's reimagining of music produced by corporate entities on albums like:REDEFINING THE WORKPLACE by INTERNET CLUBCreativity in the Workplace Part 1 by Azuresands大麻Welcome To Crystal Valley Mall by モールFUTURE/PASTAnd on tracks like:Lindsheaven Virtual Plaza - IBM Lotus NightＹｏｕ，  Ｔｈｅ  Ｃｏｎｓｕｍｅｒ  Ａｎｄ  Ｔｈｅｉｒ  ＭｏｔｉｖａｔｉｏｎOther vaporwave works push their capitalist commentary further; imagining how a benevolent corporate overlord may one day rule our lives. The albumBiosphere 0​.​2 by Cyber Surfer 3Dtakes place in a post-industrial future where oxygen is now produced by air production factories.In vaporwave, some track titles and album names employ trademark ™, copyright ©, and registered ® Unicode symbols, corporate abbreviations (like inc., corp., ltd., etc.), and business language; to help comment on ideas around capitalism and nostalgia.The chart below illustrates the preponderance of business-related Unicode characters and other corporate jargon in vaporwave track titles. The trademark character is the most common corporate symbol we came across, followed the the abbreviation \"corp\". As you might have guessed, these symbols appear in vaporwave more frequently than in synthwave.Here are examples that make use of these symbols and abbreviations:Welcome to New World™ from New World™ by Nouveau Life™100% Electronica™ Presents: \"SOFTWARE - Island Sunrise\" by ESPRIT 空想travel™ by FM SkylineHome Shopping Solutions™ from FUTURE VISION CONCEPTS ltd. by Jamie Bathgateレユニオン ｂｕｓｉｎｅｓｓ . ｃｏｒｐ® コダック by KODAKModern Romantic Lighting Solutions LLC by Digital VoyagerNew Dreams Ltd. by Laserdisc Visions𝘚𝘰𝘧𝘵 𝘚𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘮 95 ©U L T R A L I T E © 19920 ltd.One of the earliest analyses of vaporwave's relationship with capitalism is the widely cited \"Vaporwave and the pop-art of the virtual plaza\" by Adam Harper, published in Dummymag. Harper discusses if vaporwave is anti-capitalist satire, and whether it serves toacceleratecapitalism toward \"the insanity and anarchically fluid violence that is its ultimate conclusion\".Harper's article was published in 2012, when vaporwave was in its infancy. Since its publication, many have reacted by calling these sorts of vaporwave-is-a-commentary-on-capitalism analyses nonsense.Well, are they? Redditor fancifuldaffodilcalled the article\"super reductive and over-intellectualized\", noting that \"over confident positing of vaporwave as this grand capitalist critique was about as pretentious as writing on the topic gets\".Others say that vaporwave is only framed as a commentary on capitalismbecause ofHarper's early analysis, and that Harper's lens was too narrowly focused. Reddit user _PS1tells usto \"blame Adam Harper for thinking [the James Ferraro album]Far Side Virtualwas the end-all be-all of vaporwave themes.\"Yes, Far Side Virtual was commentary on capitalism/consumerism... In an an interview, Ferraro said: \"If you really want to understand Far Side, first off, listen to [Claude] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks-- buy this book and go home.  If you do all these things you’ll understand what Far Side Virtual is-- because people kind of live in it already.\"But what about vaporwave as a whole? Let's look at the data.Harper's article was published in the same month that the vaporwave subreddit was created, prior to there being an established vaporwave community, and well before the genre peaked. When Harper was discussing vaporwave's relationship to capitalism, use of \"corporate\" text characterswasrising. However, the vaporwave music and community that we know today, did not yet exist.As vaporwave grew, the use of corporate symbols in track titles faded.If the music of vaporwave reflects the genre's use of text, then Harper wasn't wrong -- but he was analyzing the genre in its infancy. The art form is not stagnant. Contemporary analyses of the genre need to broaden their scopes beyond critiques of capitalism. Vaporwave has many themes running through its veins; and many more ways to use Unicode.Nostalgia.exeBits and pieces of outdated technologies frequently creep into the vaporwave aesthetic. This might be a reflection of our longing for the technology of a bygone era. Or... this might be a comment on, what Bandcamp's blogcalls\"the 21st century’s pretensions of being unparalleled in its technological sophistication\". It's probably a little bit of both.Track names, like the ones below, seem to reference technology products and brands from a bygone era -- even if some of these technologies never actually existed.Quadra 650 - VHSVHS LOGOS -  SONYDELTA金TOPCOTOYOTAセリカ - 死角をチェックWindows彡96 - Red SkiesOther tracks take a different approach. They are named to appear as technological artifacts themselves. These track titles are written to look as if they were found on an old backup tape, or discovered on a dust covered PC laying dormant in the attic. To achieve this effect, vaporwave artists employ the tactic of incorporating file extensions into their track names.Prior to Windows 95, vaporwave's darling operating system, PC users were accustomed to seeing file names followed by 3 letter extensions. File extensions helped users determine that SOLITAIRE.EXE was an executable file, README.TXT was a text file, and SYSTEM.INI was some sort of scary config file that you shouldn't mess with.Here are examples of vaporwave tracks, albums, and artists that use file extensions:esprit.wavfrom the album virtua.zipA2.wmvDERELICT​メ​ガ​タ​ワ​ーby death's dynamic shroud.wmv裏ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ無職.ｅｘｅdiana_ross.wavG_R_A_D_I_E_N_T___.TXTlesbian dating.AVIArena Phantasyby m a g g i e . w a vNearly one in one hundred vaporwave tracks use file extensions to pay homage to the technologies of the past.Furthermore, the specific file extensions used in vaporwave often belong to file formats that were at peak popularity in the 80's and 90's. Some are now obsolete.Older extensions like AVI and WMV (introduced by Microsoft in 1992 and 1999, respectively) are more likely to appear, compared to modern formats like MP4 and MOV. Other extensions used are even more obscure, arcane, or ironic.There are other \"text tricks\" that vaporwave artists employ, to make their works seem like technological artifacts from a lost future. For example...ANSI & ASCII artIn the 80s and early 90s, before web access was easy to come by, the BBS was how tech-savvy folks connected. Users who dialed into bulletin board systems often encountered user interfaces, logos, and full blown art galleries made with ASCII and ANSI characters. ANSI art had become a well-established form of art by the time BBS reached peak popularity.In 1993, AOL started mailing CDs to prospective customers and web access became more commonplace. This paved the path for the BBS's demise. Along with internet access, came a shift away from monospaced fonts in general. And so, ANSI and ASCII art's popularity began to fade.While other forms of retro digital art (pixel art, MS paint, etc.) are more prevalent on vaporwave album covers, ANSI and ASCII art do exist within the genre.Vaporwave albums like†Nematophy by Windows96,Reference by Ｉｓａａｃ Ａｓｃｉｉ,GLOOM by Nacre Repo, andABANDONED MEMORY by $AGEISKAMIinfuse ASCII and ANSI art into their designs.ANSI art is also found in the description on Blank Banshee'sYouTube channel.As we've been discussing, the vaporwave aesthetic isn't just limited to music and album covers. To reference the look of ANSI art, vaporwave artists incorporate text characters from the \"Block Elements\", \"Geometric Shapes\", and \"Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols\" Unicode blocks into track titles -- transporting listeners to the days of ANSI, BBSes, and the late night beeps, hisses, and cracklings of 56k modems.Here are some tracks that use Unicode to emulate the ANSI art stylings of the 80s and 90s:§E▲ ▓F D▓G§▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒?1984 ░▒▓████▓▒░░.HIGHWAY PETROL.░░▒▓███ ▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀ ▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀Spend some time alone ░▒▓█【自分のための時間\u0000\u0000】█▓▒░高速道路►►►While only a small fraction of vaporwave tracks use these ANSI-looking Unicode block characters, it is clear that vaporwave makes use of them far more often than synthwave.Japan in the 80s saw the emergence ofkaomoji, which use Japanese characters alongside ASCII to form emoticons ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ). These cute little text strings can be read without needing to tilt your head to the side. Kaomoji remain popular in Japan and throughout the world. They are also seen in vaporwave, on tracks like:｡◕‿◕｡ＳＵＰＥＲ ＭＥＭＯＲＹ スーパーメモリ❤KuroNeko❤ ヽ(=^･ω･^=)丿足を浸す . . . ˚✧₊⁎( ˘ω˘ )⁎⁺˳✧༚For what it's worth, the \"Symbols for Legacy Computing\" Unicode block most closely overlaps with the characters used to make ANSI art. However, this block is quite new. It was introduced in 2020, in version 13 of the Unicode standard. Vendor support for characters in this block is limited. Many of its characters don't render in web browsers or operating systems yet.When did ANSI-ish characters start appearing in vaporwave? Are they gaining or losing popularity?░▒▓ ANSI-looking ▓▒░ characters from the Block Elements block started becoming more common in vaporwave text in 2018. The fact that these Unicode characters are gaining popularity in vaporwave's twilight years could be a sign that the genre has yet to stagnate; vaporwave artists are still innovating.Math≠𝙼𝒂𝔱𝕙Another set of characters that began showing up in vaporwave well past the genre's peak, are ones that look like 𝒯𝐇𝕀𝚂. These characters belong to the \"Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols\" block. They were designed for use in mathematical notation, equations, and formulas.For vaporwave artists (and pretty much everyone else on the internet), these characters are used to mimic bold, italic, monospace, and other text styles; on platforms that lack native text formatting tools. Copying and pasting these Unicode characters allows artists on sites like Bandcamp and SoundCloud to stand out and be more playful with their use of typography.Here are some examples of vaporwave track titles that use these stylized letters:𝙿 𝙸 𝚁 𝙰 𝚃 𝙴 𝚂 カ​リ​ブ​海​の -​𝘸​𝘢​𝘪​𝘵 𝘵​𝘪​𝘮​𝘦​- 3hr 10min𝘯​𝘦​𝘷​𝘦​𝘳 𝘦​𝘯​𝘥​𝘪​𝘯​𝘨 𝘦​𝘷​𝘦​𝘯​𝘪​𝘯​𝘨​𝘴ℝ​Ⓘ​s​к​ㄚ ᗷ​𝐄​н​Ã​𝐯​ι​σ​г🐟𝐨𝓬𝕖คℕ '83🐟ＯＡＳＩＳスグが & ★𝓡𝓸𝓬𝓴𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓻★ - Ｈ Ｏ Ｔ Ｅ Ｌ 情報広告 (w/ MIDNIGHT 88.1 FM)𝗹𝗶𝗹​​:​​𝘀𝗶ː 僅かな波の断片EPOn YayText, we've built tools that make it easy to stylize text using these characters.

The use of bold, italic, and other styles comprised from this block has yet to show signs of slowing.Is vaporwave dead?The changes over time in how vaporwave artists use fullwidth letters, Japanese characters, corporate symbols, characters from Unicode's alphanumeric math block, etc. are all signs of deeper changes within the movement.To understand the full picture of how vaporwave has evolved, let's pair our analysis of the text with the insights of someone who's watched vaporwave unfold since day one.Van Paugam is a Chicago-based DJ who works with 80s Japanese funk, disco, and city pop. He has been listening to vaporwave since 2010. Paugam has written multipleblogpostsbased on his \"decade's worth of examining what goes on in the [vaporwave] scene\",  describing its transformation from 2010 to present day.2010 - 2011According to Van Paugam, the earliest days of vaporwave had a \"spirit of innovation and experimentation\". The sounds being produced were \"almost anti-capitalist, Marxist interpretations of music that defied traditional expectations\". At this point in time, the genre was \"dripping with sincerity and curious flirtation with the potential for a new age punk mentality\".The genre's spirit of experimentation extended to text as well, as vaporwave artists began to explore ways that Unicode text could be manipulated. In vaporwave's infancy, artists used ™ symbols, CJK characters (構), and ▚block▞ characters. However, the vaporwave text style that we know today did not yet exist.2012 - 2014In the years following vaporwave's birth, the genre saw a clear rise in both popularity and artistic experimentation. Communities of listeners began to form, and according to Google search data, more people began to ask \"what is vaporwave?\".The year 2014 was also the beginning of what Van Paugam calls vaporwave's \"hyper-sensitive years\" -- \"when even just basic feedback would be met with hostility\" and \"everyone's artistic expressions, however deranged were 'valid'\".While some Unicode tactics still had more growth to come, these were the peak years for use of corporate symbols. Perhaps these were also the peak years for the expression of anti-capitalist notions within the genre.2015 - 2016In 2015, vaporwave began to peak. While uploads to SoundCloud and Bandcamp were at an all-time high, artistic innovation slowed. Major publications chimed in: Esquiredeclared\"vaporwave is dead\", and Viceblamedthe genre's death on Tumblr and MTV.Vaporwave artists themselves also proclaimed the genre dead.Use of Unicode symbols like ™ and © declined. According to Van Paugam, 2015 was when vaporwave artists began to \"abandon any smidge of philosophical, anti-capitalist, or marxist tendencies.\" These are the years that vaporwave went mainstream, leading to \"a corruption of its original ideals and philosophies regarding the sound and aesthetic\".During this same period of time, the r/VaporwaveAesthetics subreddit began to experience growth, reflecting a broader focus on a visual look that Paugam calls a \"parasitic neon haze\".Tutorials for \"how to make vaporwave\" began to crop up on YouTube, and the aesthetic stopped evolving. Many tracks produced during this time period were \"low effort\", where the sampled music was simply slowed down.This low level of creative effort can be seen in the cookie cutter use of Unicode as well. The \"formula\" for creating a track title -- with CJK and fullwidth text -- hit its peak in 2015. And, for the many artists who didn't knowhowto use fullwidth, the formula for sticking space characters between letters peaked as well.2017 - 2018The year 2017 marked the beginning of vaporwave's musical decline, but not its death. Instead, the music and the visual components of vaporwave decoupled. According to Paugum, \"vaporwave [became] all about its visual components rather than audio production quality\".While activity on SoundCloud, BandCamp, and r/vaporwave slowly decreased; the \"aesthetic\" saw increased activity. Visually-minded vaporwave communities like the r/VaporwaveAesthetics subreddit saw growth.Vaporwave's visual renaissance created a renewed interest in experimenting with Unicode, especially in ways that were visually interesting. The years 2017 and 2018 saw growth in the use of Unicode characters that complemented the aesthetic, but had little to do with the philosophies of earlier vaporwave. ANSI-looking characters and mathematical alphanumerics became more popular.2019 - todayThe decoupling of the visual from the music did nothing to ensure vaporwave's sustained popularity. In the past few years, there has been a significant decrease in Google search interest for vaporwave as well as a decline in visually-minded vaporwave communities like /r/VaporwaveAesthetics.The period of renewed artistic experimentation with Unicode that began in 2018 did not last long. Use of alphanumeric math and ANSI-like characters remained constant, offering a slightly different flavor of the same Unicode text \"formula\" we saw in 2015.While many vaporwave artistspush backon the idea that the genre is dead; it has definitely changed. According to Van Paugam, today vaporwave is \"a fractured mess but still glued together by a supergroup of producers and scenesters who will defend [it] to its bitter end.\"One phenomenon that has consistently exhibited growth from 2010 to the present, is the use of \"vaporwave\" as atagon SoundCloud and Bandcamp. While it has become less common for musicians to list vaporwave as their primary genre, they have continued to use the term as a secondary tag for categorizing their music.Perhaps, in the genre's death throes, \"vaporwave\" has become... an adjective.Today, vaporwave's sound and aesthetic are predictable. If we stick the word \"vaporwave\" in a DALL-E prompt, we have a good sense of what the result will look like. Similarly, if we type text into one of the many \"vaporwave text generators\" available online (including our own), the result is also ｐｒｅｄｉｃｔａｂｌｅ®組織With Unicode's 327 blocks and nearly 150,000 characters, the text encoding standard is ripe for further exploration. Time will only tell if vaporwave can continue to serve fertile ground for that sort of experimentation. However, as long as artists have the ability to copy, paste,andplaywithUnicodetextcharacters...makingartwithUnicodeພ९ꝆꝆ ਜ਼ລⳁⳁ౬৵. 🔚PublishedWednesday May 3rd, 2023We'd love to hear from you.

      "Code the Shortest Path First | varchar(255)HomeAll postsAboutRSSPrevious postNext postBack to topShare postCode the Shortest Path First2023-06-24There is a strange thing that I noticed as I progressed from a junior engineer to mid-career to senior. When you’re a new engineer, still learning the basics, you are given a task or you have an idea, and you proceed to implement exactly that idea. Very simple, point A to point B, whatever gets the job done. You hate your code later but yougot it to work. Then you learn some stuff– you learn about object-oriented design & algorithms & design patterns & frameworks & abstractions & higher-order functions & monoids & whatever else you found on Hacker News. And you’ll start new projects, and you’ll think you should use some of those things, and you may notice that you don’t finish things as quickly, or not at all. Someday you find yourself on a team of engineers & it will seem like the whole team is getting less done than you got done on your own as a beginner who didn’t know anything.The thing that gets lost at this stage as that, with a new task of any complexity, you still just need to code the shortest path from point A to point B. At this point it can help toexplicitly ignorethinking about the best abstraction to use or The Right Way of Doing Things! That can come later. If it’s a true greenfield project you are “prototyping”, if it’s part of an existing project you are making a “tracer bullet”. The concept is the same– do the minimum work to get from point A to point B. Point A is the current state of the code, point B is code that fulfills the feature requirements. It might beuglycode, but if itfulfills the requirementsyou have succeeded.Do notfactor your code too early!This may seem obvious but it can get lost, especially when working on sizeable team– there is always someone suggesting to pause and spend days setting up a CI/CD pipeline, or use a cool new library they just found, or refactor some module so it’s more DRY/decoupled. These people are not strictly wrong, but they’re not completely right. Do the requirements dictate any of those things? Have you solved the hardest part of the task at hand? If not, don’t do that other crap.The reason you should do things in this order, is that you might refactor the module or setup the CI environment, and then learn that your whole approach to the problem was wrong. You have to throw it out & start over & potentially a lot of those other things you did are now a waste of time. This is why work needs to be doneholisticallyat the start– the pressure to keep people occupied & parallelize work will cause you toprematurely divide the problem along arbitrary boundaries. The proper abstractions that best delineate roles do not necessarily emerge on the first try, it’s better to be able to sculpt them into place over repeated encounters with the problem space. This is why you want to be on asmall teamthat takes ownership of their entire piece of the problem space– the same people need to have repeated encounters with the problem in order for the right patterns to emerge.Now this can lead to a problem: You have a crap piece of code on a feature branch that accomplishes exactly the minimum set of requirements at hand. Maybe you demoed it to Product. Can you ship it? No.Nowyou have to allocate time to refactor the ugly parts, write tests, etc. This will sculpt your sketchy prototype/tracer bullet into something shippable. This can be tricky to negotiate when interfacing with product management, the right approach depends on the relationship. Make your PM aware of the undiscovered parts of the problem, explain exactly what you’re trying to learn, or hide the task in some kind of opaque “prototyping” bucket. You can’t allow a product team with tight deadlines to kill or forever sweep under the rug essential aspects of SDLC– if it’s software that’s going to ship, it needs tests, it needs CI/CD, & you might need to refactor a few things so the code makes sense to future you. It probably shouldn’t land onmainwithout those things, but you shouldn’t be doing all of your development as tho ithasto land onmain.Like everything else, this is a judgement call. It’s possible nothing about the problem at-hand is that complicated, you already know what the most logical division of labor is, so the boundaries you draw are not arbitrary. In that case you can parallelize, you can workprescriptively. But anytime you’re attempting a problem that is new, unexplored, if the probability of failure is greater than 20% or so, code the shortest path first.HomeAll postsAboutRSSMenuTOCshareTopCopyright  © 2023  varchar(255)HomeAll postsAboutRSS\n",

And they’re increasingly considering programs that can net them savings if they agree to share driving data with their insurer from a phone app or an in-vehicle device.Usage-based car insurance programs, also known as telematics insurance, have a fairly simple premise: If you can demonstrate that you’re a low-risk driver based on your behavior behind the wheel, you’re rewarded with a lower premium.The programs typically monitor data that relates to how you drive, when you drive or where you drive — or, some combination of the three, explains Deloitte Principal Matthew Carrier, who consults with insurance clients.“The industry and certain carriers recognized that this data could allow them to evaluate risk better and better match the price of the insurance for the risk,” Carrier says.Examples of what’s tracked include hard braking, sharp turns and texting and driving. The programs may also consider your mileage and the routes you take, among other things when determining the kind of driver you are.Erica Eversman, president of the Automotive Education and Policy Institute, argues that you’re trading privacy to save money, and that’s not a deal she’s willing to make.“I think ​​it is incredibly intrusive. It provides a significant amount of data to insurers, and we don't necessarily know what they are doing with that data and whether they are being responsible with that data,” she says.Ads by Money.

Power.During the pandemic, consumers were interested in usage-based insurance programs because they were staying home and not driving much, Carrier says. Now drivers are interested for different reasons. Car insurance costs aresoaringdue to inflation and an increase inserious accidents, so customers want to save money any way they can. According to the J.D. Power report, these changes in the market indicate interest in these products will likely remain high and could keep growing.Usage-based car insurance has been around for more than a decade, but the early versions of the technology generally relied on devices you’d have to install in your car.Now, lots of new vehicles are sold with built-in systems for sending data to insurance companies. Customers also have more options to participate with smartphone apps like Geico's DriveEasy or State Farm’s Drive Safe & Save.Depending on the program, you may have to drive with the tracking on for 30 days to six months before your discount (if any) kicks in. Some insurers also offer an immediate discount as an incentive to sign up.Keep in mind that when you use an app to track your driving, it will likely also track your phone usage while behind the wheel. For example, GEICO’s DriveEasy program monitors handheld phone calls and the use of your phone when moving over 6 mph.Should you opt in?The pros and cons of enrolling in a usage-based car insurance program depend on what type of driver you are and where your priorities lie.Insurance companies may think you’re a higher-risk driver if you’re accelerating fast, braking aggressively, making sharp turns, using your phone while you drive, coming home at 3 a.m., taking dangerous roads or simply driving a lot.If you don’t do any of those things, you might get a larger discount — though exactly how much you'll save with these programs is unclear, experts say.Auto insurance companies claim you can save up to 20-30% on your premium with usage-based insurance, but Michael DeLong, research and advocacy associate at the Consumer Federation of America, emphasizes that those are maximums, and the real savings are probably much lower. Unfortunately, there haven’t been any reliable studies on how much drivers are actually saving, he says.Critics of usage-based insurance programs say you shouldn’t have to give up your privacy just to get affordable car insurance, among other potential problems like phone battery drain or the technology classifying you as a bad driver leading to a premium increase. (Many insurance companies, however, claim your rates won’t go up based on the data it collects when you enroll in a telematics program.)On the other hand, proponents argue it can be a win-win for customers and insurers: Drivers save money and auto insurance companies can price their insurance products more efficiently.What do the users think? According to J.D. Power, while participants have concerns about the tracking accuracy, they report higher satisfaction with the price of their insurance than other customers.The drawbacksThere are a number of possible issues and downsides of usage-based car insurance, consumer advocates say.For example, some companies deem late-night driving to be dangerous, which is unfortunate for people who work late hours. “That could disproportionately hurt low income consumers who are working at these jobs,” DeLong says.The technology also has its limitations: If you’re at the wheel focused on the road, but someone in the passenger seat is changing the music on your phone, the app may think it’s observing distracted driving and count it against you.It's also important to keep in mind that you may actually end up paying more for car insurance by opting in, especially if you put in a lot of miles on the road. While there are other ways for insurance companies to see how much you drive — mileage is often documented when you get service on your car at a dealership — a sensor inside the car can be the “ultimate” tool for insurers to identify drivers who are spending a lot of time on the road, Carrier says.In the event you get in an accident, an insurance company could potentially use collected data to try to prove you were at fault, according to accident lawyers. Geico acknowledges that it may use DriveEasy data “to help accelerate the claims process.”Sarah Graziano, a civil attorney at Hensley Legal Group in Indiana who represents injured parties, adds that the data can be subpoenaed in civil and criminal cases. For now, this is relatively uncommon, but she expects that to change as more insurance companies promote discounts and more drivers opt in.The Consumer Federation of America says it is worried that the data insurers are collecting on participants’ movements could be misused, DeLong says, noting that most states lack regulation preventing it from being sold to advertisers.However, DeLong recognizes opting in or not is a tough decision for drivers. He admits that it could make sense for some people - if you’re a good driver, you drive fewer miles than average and you're comfortable with the privacy protections provided by your state’s laws.Ads by Money.

      "Database Architects: Fun with CHARDatabase ArchitectsA blog by and for database architects.Thursday, January 8, 2015Fun with CHARThe CHAR(n) data type is one of the more bizarre features of SQL. It is supposed to represent a fixed-length string, but as we will see in a moment, it behaves odd in all kinds of ways. IMHO it should never be used for anything. There might be use cases for CHAR(1), i.e., for storing a single character, but as a string data type its semantics are so odd and broken that it should never be used.At a first glance, CHAR is simple. CHAR(n) means that the corresponding value is a string with a fixed length of n, padding with space as needed. Thusselect cast('A' as CHAR(5))----'A    'An easy concept, except that people apparently noticed that such a data types would not be very useful in practice when comparing values like this:create table foo(x char(5));create table bar(y char(10));select * from foo,bar where x=y;If we would take the \"fixed-length string\" semantic literally, we would never find join partners, asxandywillalwaysdiffer due to their different length.To fix that, the SQL standard mandated that for comparison purposes CHAR values are implicitly padded with<space>until they reach the length of the other string. Which means that'A  '   = 'A    ' (char(3) and char(5))=> 'A    ' = 'A    '=> trueWhich \"fixed\" the comparison problem, but caused all kinds of other problems. Note that the padding behavior is always active, even when comparing with non-CHAR strings like VARCHAR. This results in absurd semantic issues:create table foo(x varchar(10),y char(5),z varchar(10));insert into foo values ('A ','A','A  ');select x=y, y=z, x=z from foo;----T T FEquality is no longer transitive! The CHAR/VARCHAR comparisons do add the padding to the shorter CHAR string, and thus compare as equal. The VARCHAR comparisons use the literal values, and thus compare as not equal. This kills transitivity, ruins all kinds of query optimizer reasoning, and is a pain in general.This implicit padding behavior also ruins hash-based approaches, as we cannot know beforehand how many spaces we would have to add, which makes computing hash-values impossible. A common remedy for that is to do the exact opposite of what CHAR is supposed to mean, namely always strip all trailing spaces from CHAR values, and then for comparisons also strip trailing spaces from the comparison partner. We always have a unique representation for CHAR values then, and can use hashing. The only problem is that this affects observable behavior, as there are a few characters that should be sorted before space (depending on the collation, of course):create table foo(x char(3));insert into foo values (''),(chr(3));select * from foo order by x;----'   ''\\x03  'This is the output order thatPostgreSQLandHyPerare producing, but strictly speaking the tuples should be in the other order, aschr(3)<chr(32). Fortuntately most users do not care about characters below space, so we can get away with the trimming trick.After all these problems, what might be reasons that speak in favor ofCHAR(n)(withn>1)? To be honest, I have no idea. In the past one argument in favor ofCHARmight have been that fixed-length strings are easier to handle than variable length strings. But that argument is largely moot today. Note that, at least by default, the \"n\" specifies the number of characters, not the number of bytes. When usingUnicodethis is not very helpful for determining the length of the string, unless one wants to waste a lot of space. ThusCHARstrings are not really fixed length, anyway. They cause a lot of problems, but have virtually no benefit overVARCHAR.Fun data point that I noticed when comparingHyPerwith other database systems: Even well established systems like PostgreSQL get theCHARsemantics wrong. PostgreSQL 9.4 does it correct when comparing withVARCHAR, but forgets to pad when comparing toTEXT(but trims instead, which completely ruins the comparison):select 'A'::char(2) ='A '::varchar(10) => Tselect 'A'::char(2) ='A '::text        => Fselect 'A '::char(2)='A '::text        => FDon't use CHAR(n). Use VARCHAR(n) or TEXT.Posted byThomas Neumannat11:01 PMEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest7 comments:Thomas NeumannJanuary 16, 2015 at 12:38 PMPosting from the type providers article (mean to be here):>> The VARCHAR comparisons use the literal values, and thus compare as not equal.>> As far as I understand it, this is wrong. The ANSI standard is that trailing spaces are *not* significant in comparison of VARCHAR values.Note that the query example is a bit more subtle: The \"x=y\" comparison is a \"VARCHAR=CHAR\" comparison, and thus ignores trailing spaces. The \"y=z\" comparison is a \"CHAR=VARCHAR\" comparison, and thus also ignores trailing spaces.But the \"x=z\" comparison is a \"VARCHAR=VARCHAR\" comparison, ans thus does _not_ ignore trailing spaces, which breaks transitivity. (As x=y, and y=z, but x is not = to z).Which is completely weird and counter-intuitive, but that is what the standard says. And if you add the fact the CHAR is basically broken in popular database systems like PostgreSQL (they have a lot of bugs there, for example ''::char(1) like ''::char(1) returns false), you see that CHAR(n) is not a very useful data type in practice.ReplyDeleteRepliesRichard BJanuary 16, 2015 at 1:09 PM> comparison is a \"VARCHAR=VARCHAR\" comparison, ans thus does _not_ ignore trailing spacesNo, that is the bit I was objecting to - I didn;t think that was true.  For example this is culled from documentation about SQL/Serve:>>    SQL Server follows the ANSI/ISO SQL-92 specification (Section 8.2, , General rules #3) on how to compare strings with spaces. The ANSI standard requires padding for the character strings used in comparisons so that their lengths match before comparing them. The padding directly affects the semantics of WHERE and HAVING clause predicates and other Transact-SQL string comparisons. For example, Transact-SQL considers the strings 'abc' and 'abc ' to be equivalent for most comparison operations.The only exception to this rule is the LIKE predicate. When the right side of a LIKE predicate expression features a value with a trailing space, SQL Server does not pad the two values to the same length before the comparison occurs. Because the purpose of the LIKE predicate, by definition, is to facilitate pattern searches rather than simple string equality tests, this does not violate the section of the ANSI SQL-92 specification mentioned earlier.  <<DeleteRepliesReplyRichard BJanuary 16, 2015 at 1:37 PMMore info FWIW:If I recall, DB2, SQL/Server and MySQL follow the standard in treating trailing spaces as not significant, Oracle is different (legitimately as they call their type VARCHAR2 not VARCHAR) and Postgres is broken in the limited sense that it does not follow the standard in this respect and of course can't be changed now.DeleteRepliesReplyThomas NeumannJanuary 16, 2015 at 2:09 PMI have just re-read the SQL standard (Subclause 8.2). And it says:\"\"If the length in characters of X is not equal to the length in characters of Y, then the shorter string is effectively replaced, for the purposes of comparison, with a copy of itself that has been extended to the length of the longer string by concatenation on the right of one or more pad characters, where thepad character is chosen based on CS. If CS has the NO PAD characteristic, then the pad character is an implementation-dependent character different from any character in the character set of X and Y that collates less than any string under CS. Otherwise, the pad character is a .\"\"The only problem is that it is implementation defined if we have to use NO PAD here or not.Clearly, CHAR has to be padded with spaces, at least up to the declared length. If VARCHAR has to be padded, too, is implementation defined.I ran the following SQL query on different systems to see how they behaveselect case when cast('a' as varchar(10))=cast('a ' as varchar(10)) then 'T' else 'F' end from (table with one tuple)Result:Oracle: not equalSQL Server: equalPostgreSQL: not equalDB2: equalHyPer: not equalSQLIte: not equalMonetDB: not equalSo there is no consensus between systems, some do ignore the trailing spaces, some do not.edit: blogger at my less and greater symbolsDeleteRepliesReplyRichard BJanuary 16, 2015 at 3:04 PM>Otherwise, the pad character is a .Blogger ate the the word \"space\" at the end of that sentence I think for anyone else reading :)Fair enough,So, in effect, the question becomes whether or not you are implictly using a collation sequence (CS) that has the NO_PAD characteristic or the PAD_SPACE characteristic.  And this differs between databases.I don't know how an implicit CS is determined, I find one comment elsewhere referring to Subclause 9.13 but I don't have a copy of the standard.So, it would seem, if you want transitive equality across the character types you do need a collation sequence with the PAD_SPACE character..But I simply don't know the extent to which the various databases allow you to control the collation sequence applicable and/or create a collation sequence with the PAD_SPACE characteristic so you can resolve this problem when you want to.  Maybe it's just a messy area.DeleteRepliesReplyThomas NeumannJanuary 16, 2015 at 3:15 PMI think it is messy. Way too many things in the SQL standard are implementation defined, which in practice means that different systems will implement it differently.By the way, if you want to look at the SQL standard (without paying CHF 198) you can look ata current draft versionfor free. Not identical to the published standard, of course, but for all practical purposes close enough. The comparison rules are on page 505.DeleteRepliesReplyReplyRichard BJanuary 16, 2015 at 7:11 PMThanks for the link, much appreciated.ReplyDeleteRepliesReplyAdd commentLoad more...Newer PostOlder PostHomeSubscribe to:Post Comments (Atom)ContributorsPeter BonczThomas NeumannViktor LeisBlog Archive►2023(3)►April(1)►February(1)►January(1)►2022(7)►June(5)►April(1)►January(1)►2021(2)►July(1)►June(1)►2020(4)►November(1)►October(1)►April(1)►January(1)►2019(3)►July(1)►May(1)►February(1)►2018(2)►June(1)►April(1)►2017(2)►December(1)►February(1)►2016(2)►August(1)►April(1)▼2015(7)►December(1)►September(1)►July(1)►June(1)►April(1)►February(1)▼January(1)Fun with CHAR►2014(11)►December(1)►September(1)►August(1)►July(2)►June(2)►May(4)Simple theme.

But we talked to those professionals, and they don’t want it — because Apple’s other computers are just too good.ByMonica Chin,a senior reviewer covering laptops and other gadgets. Monica was a writer for Tom's Guide and Business Insider before joining The Verge in 2020.Photo byAmelia Holowaty KralesJun 27, 2023, 1:00 PM UTC|CommentsShare this storyIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement.Apple’s latest Mac Pro wasfinally revealedat this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference as a machine for the most power user of power users. Thevideodiscussed audio engineering, color grading, and video transcoding.Apple’s product pagementions code compiling, animation, compositing 8K scenes, 3D rendering, and “analyzing enormous datasets.” This isn’t just for pros, Apple seems to claim; it’s for capital-PPros.Exactly who these pros are andwhythe Mac Pro is the perfect device for them remains somewhat unclear to me, even after testing the new machine for a few days and speaking to various professionals that Apple is ostensibly targeting. That’s in part because Apple, on the same day it announced the Mac Pro, also announced a smaller, M2 UltraMac Studiowith the exact same RAM, storage, and processor options. The former, nevertheless, costs at least $3,000 more and carries a towering starting priceof $6,999.I wanted to know whether Apple’s purported target demographic — people who spend their days animating, making visual effects, and doing various other tasks generally associated with big, powerful computers — were actually interested in purchasing this machine. So I asked a bunch of them, and the answer, basically across the board, was no. Not because the Mac Pro is bad but because Apple’s other computers, namely its laptops, have just gotten too good.RelatedThe Mac Pro ends the Apple Silicon transition, but it’s just one step in a much bigger journeyMac Pro with M2 Ultra first look: boy, that’s a big chipApple Mac Studio (2023) review: the M2 Ultra ripsZach Passero, who does editing, animation, and visual effects for films, has been a diehard Mac Pro user for over a decade. “I’m still a big champion of the old trash can,” he says, referring to theoft-maligned 2013 design. He was skeptical when the M1 Max chip was announced — he’d never envisioned that a laptop could handle his heavy workload. But he gave the16-inch MacBook Proa shot and was surprised — and a little bit sad — to find that it felt just as fast as his older desktop. “Video editing, even doing effects, compositing, animating — it has been a smooth and fluid process,” he says. “I’m like, ‘This might actually suffice for a while.’”Passero still loves the Mac Pro, but he can’t justify buying the latest one when his laptop is so good. “There’s something about my experience using the M1 chip where I’m like, ‘I don’t know if I need the full Mac Pro,’” he says, with some disappointment in his voice.Vikram Bodicherla, a staff privacy engineer at WhatsApp, previously owned two Intel-based Mac Pro models — one for home and one for work. The minute the M1 Max came out, he jettisoned both of them. Like Passero, Bodicherla now spends his day — he works on mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as “server-side stuff” — on a MacBook Pro with the M1 Max. He can build much faster. He hasn’t even considered buying Apple’s new desktop. “I don’t really need any other computer,” he says.Kevin Ford, who shoots and edits documentaries, has been using the Mac Pro for years. He’s owned both the tower models and the trash can. But he switched to the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M2 Max a few weeks ago, and he’s not looking back — it can do everything he needs. He can cut 4K and 6K footage. He can color correct. He can even create graphics and titles. As a bonus, he can now do it all on the road; the last project he cut, which is now on Netflix, was done entirely in hotel rooms and airplanes.“I’m very practical when I’m looking at a piece of equipment — what will allow me to do what I need to do for the best cost?” Ford says. “If the cheese grater was priced at a certain point, would that have been more attractive to me? Possibly.” But, he adds, his new MacBook is “working very well.”We tested our machine with a Pro Display XDR.But it’s not just that the MacBook has gotten better with the release of Apple’s M-series chips. The Mac Pro, with the release of the Mac Studio, has also gotten significantly more confusing.The Pro I received to test vastly outperforms Intel models from 2019 — even those with Apple’s fancy Afterburner card thatcost thousands of dollars more. But it’s a step backward from those other models in another way: modularity.The 2019 Mac Pro was endlessly configurable, and ports could be swapped out and upgraded as users needed. Much has changed. Spec choice is now more limited (there are only two processor options, for example, and memory is now capped at 192GB where previously up to 1.5TB was available). The 2023 Mac Pro’s memory is not upgradeable after purchase for the first time in the model’s history.And now, of course, the Mac Studio is here. And while the Pro delivers impressive performance, you can now get that same performance in a less expensive and much more compact chassis.I had similarly specced models of the Pro and the Studio on hand to test. Both included Apple’s 24-core M2 Ultra processor with 76 GPU cores, as well as 128GB of unified memory. While the two look quite different, and the Mac Pro has a couple extra ports, I can confirm that their performance is close to the same.It’s much bigger than the Studio, but the numbers are not far apart.The primary advantage that the Mac Pro can claim over the Studio is the fact that the former has PCIe expansion slots — six full-length PCIe Gen 4 slots, specifically, as well as a half-length Gen 3. These, in theory, allow for some degree of modularity, where a user could slot in additional storage, IO, or other peripherals.Except:that doesn’t include desktop GPUs, which mitigates the utility of these slots for graphic use cases significantly. The Mac hasn’t supported Nvidia cards for quite some time, and Apple’s own silicon doesn’t support AMD’s GPUs, either. Further muddling this matter is the fact that most PCI-E cards can now be used with Thunderbolt via an external enclosure — you specifically need to require the PCI-E 4 x16 speeds in order to gain a tangible benefit from those extra thousands of dollars.The slots, with those caveats, didn’t blow anyone I spoke to out of the water. “Would it be nice to have? Yeah, totally… if it wasn’t a machine that started at $7,000,” said Evan Stone, a senior iOS engineer at the software development agency MartianCraft. (Stone also works on the MacBook Pro with M1 Max, and he’s a fan; he has one for work and another at home.)Passero used to be a huge fan of the Mac Pro’s expandability, but his new MacBook performs so well that he doesn’t feel the need to add anything extra. “The new silicon chips and these built-in GPUs that they have, and the neural networks, I’m finding that most of my needs are met,” he says. “I’m like, ‘Do I just settle in and see how this goes?’”Sadly, no SD slot..The lack of support for desktop GPUs makes the feature particularly confounding for graphic professionals. “GPU support, that’s what we mostly use PCIe for,” said Tom Lindén, who runs a 3D animation agency. Other than a capture card, he says, “there are not that many expansion cards that would be useful.”The only aspect of the Pro that Lindén finds particularly compelling for his studio is its double ethernet port. “We’re simulating huge simulations, so fast networking is really important,” Lindén says. “I don’t know how much we’d be able to utilize two slots — like if that would help the speed.” He thinks for a moment. “I guess it could, probably.”“I would probably just get the Mac Studio and be done.”Emilio Guarino, a music producer and engineer, thinks that feature is mostly useful for “edge case kind of scenarios” in his field. “If you’re doing game development, I’ve seen session files where the track count is like two or three thousand. You might need the added expansion for that,” he says. “But if I’m just doing commissions or just building virtual instruments and samples... I would probably just get the Mac Studio and be done.”What about additional storage? People mostly shrugged. “I’ve never really hit that limit, and I have a very large chunk of the company’s code base on my computer,” WhatsApp’s Bodicherla says — companies as large as his, he explains, generally have processes in place that mean their engineers don’t need to hold unreasonable amounts of data on their personal machines. “If you’re doing a huge ML model, it might make sense to download everything. But even then, I feel like for running that one odd job, you could always go to, like, a server cluster,” he muses.“I can’t justify paying double for a machine that has a couple of slots,” said Danny Nathan, founder and CEO of the product design and venture studio Apollo 21.In general, the attitude among the professionals I spoke to was not skepticism so much as confusion.“I don’t know why they made two different products,” said Vyacheslav Drofa, a UX director at Alty, which engineers mobile applications for banks, as he looked bemusedly at the Studio’s and Pro’s identical spec sheets.“The offering across the board from Apple has gotten so powerful that, frankly, the Mac Pro feels a little unnecessary,” echoes Nathan, who has owned a number of Mac Pros throughout his career but is now very happy with his 14-inch MacBook. “I think we all appreciate it for what it is and what it demonstrates, but at no point has anyone said to me, ‘So when are we getting an office load of these?’”Here’s where the ports live.Many people across industries, who were confident that the Mac Pro wasn’t a good investment for them, spitballed about who it might be ideal for but weren’t exactly sure. Maybe architects need it, Stone suggested. “Really, really tough machine learning tasks,” posited Serhii Popov, a software engineer at Setapp. 3D rendering, Guarino proposed, but only if you’re doing a lot of it. DevOps, others said. But there was one use case that pretty much everyone suspected might tangibly benefit from the Mac Pro and its plethora of slots: VFX.David Lebensfeld, founder and VFX supervisor at Ingenuity Studios, was dubious. “That doesn’t seem like something a VFX studio would use,” he said after I described the product. Nobody on Lebensfeld’s team has expressed interest in the Mac Pro — there has been “zero chatter” about the product, he says.Lebensfeld’s company is all in on Windows and Linux, and that’s common for studios of Ingenuity’s size. Switching over to the Mac Pro, given its price point, would just be impractical. Lebensfeld gets better value out of Windows PCs, which support the latest GPUs from Nvidia and can be equipped with the exact parts and specs that each team needs. When a part breaks, they can grab another one off the shelf.In fact, some of the VFX and animation professionals I contacted for this story declined to be interviewed because they simply don’t know much about Macs — they just aren’t widely used in that industry at this point. The reality is that these types of studios need to keep their hardware functional and up to date. Replacing a full Mac Pro system — let alone a fleet of them — regularly would be an absurd cost.“It feels like they’re gonna put this chip in every laptop and iPad that they can, and then later, they’re gonna fuse 20 of them together, and that’s the Pro.”Lebensfeld speculated that the Mac Pro might be better for small businesses and independent artists who work with heavy graphics. But Lindén’s smaller studio is also fully a Windows shop, decked out with high-end Nvidia cards (which decisively outperform the M2 Ultrain programs like Blender), largely for the same reason. “We like to keep updating our machines with new hardware when we need to,” he says.Deborah Wright, a digital sculptor, has the same hang-ups; she also uses a Windows PC. “I really, really love Mac... but it’s become prohibitively expensive,” she says. “Part of the attractiveness of a PC is my ability to customize the heck out of it,” she adds. “You buy a Mac, and you hold onto it for a few years. Buying a PC, you’re switching out your hardware pretty regularly.”Wright suspects her next purchase might be a MacBook Pro, which, while not modular, is at least more affordable. “Their displays are just exquisite,” she says. “Velvet on the eyes.”Mac Pro (2023) BenchmarksBenchmarkMac ProMac StudioGeekbench 6 CPU Single27662623Geekbench 6 CPU Multi2120321397Geekbench 6 GPU Metal221671224158Geekbench 6 GPU Open CL128867129482Cinebench R23 Single17461735Cinebench R23 Multi2883628924Cinebench R23 Multi 30-min loop2891428902Shadow of the Tomb Raider(1080p, highest)130fps135fpsPugetBench for Premiere Pro9619754K export (Adobe Premiere Pro 23)1:021:00XCode Benchmark60.87560.448But the larger issue among the professionals I spoke to, and one that will likely take many more product cycles for Apple to truly fix, is one of trust. Apple, the business behemoth that it is, still has a reputation to build in the enterprise space. In order to become a go-to purchase for studios, Apple doesn’t just need to make the Mac Pro more competitive on price — it needs to reestablish itself as a brand that industries can rely on for years to come. And it needs to make some amends.“Apple doesn’t really have a great history of servicing this market,” Lebensfeld said. “Do you want to hang millions of dollars of equipment purchases on a company where you know this isn’t their main focus?” He added, “It really feels like an afterthought. It feels like they’re gonna put this chip in every laptop and iPad that they can, and then later, they’re gonna fuse 20 of them together, and that’s the Pro.”The middle handle is what you use to open the case and jam some PCI cards in.And while Apple’s decision tooverhaul Final Cut Prowas over a decade ago, studios still haven’t forgotten. Almost all of the video professionals I spoke to brought it up. “Every filmmaker in the world was using this,” Lebensfeld complained. “And they lost that whole market. They just don’t take it seriously.”“They really did screw us over on that,” Ford, the documentarian, agreed. “I was really upset.”I searched high and low and ended up connecting with over 20 professionals for this story in order to locate someone who enthusiastically wanted to buy the Mac Pro. I found exactly one: Drofa. He loves the cheese-grater design.“The killer feature is when somebody comes and says, ‘Okay, you have a Mac Pro,’ and I say, ‘Yeah, I can make a cheesesteak,’” he explained. Asked about the Mac Studio, he replied, “I don’t trust that small thing.”CommentsMost PopularFTC v.

This means that it evaluates to a value that can be bound to a variable. You may have heard this before as “statement vs expression”.last_names=forfriend<-friendsdofriend.last_nameendBefore reading this rest of this article, I suggest you read the list comprehension guide onelixir-lang.org. I will go over some of the same details, but hopefully will go much more in depth.GeneratorsThe primary ingredient in a comprehension is the generator. The only other place you will see this “left arrow” syntax (lhs <- rhs) is in thewithspecial form.The right hand side is the enumerable you want to loop over and the left hand side is the intermediate pattern you want to match on during each iteration. This is a normal pattern, so you can pattern match like you would anywhere else.friends=[%{first_name:\"Joe\",last_name:\"Swanson\"},%{first_name:\"Greg\",last_name:\"Mefford\"},%{first_name:\"Erik\",last_name:\"Plostins\"},]for%{last_name:last_name}<-friendsdolast_nameend# [\"Swanson\", \"Mefford\", \"Plostins\"]Multiple GeneratorsComprehensions are very concise in that you can declare multiple generators, allowing you to generate every permutation of both enumerables. A great example is generating a list of coordinate pairs from a range ofxvalues andyvalues.A key detail to recognize is that the both values are yielded to the same block, so the result is a flat list.forx<-0..99,y<-0..99do{x,y}end# [{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, ...]The counter example usingEnum.map/2is not nearly as readable and demonstrates that you need to remember to flatten the outer loop, or else you’ll get a list of lists.Enum.flat_map(0..99,fnx->Enum.map(0..99,fny->{x,y}end)end)# [{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, ...]Generators work with maps tooThe comprehension works with anything that implements theEnumerableprotocol, so you can iterate through a map as well. The generator will yield each key/value pair of the given map.dictionary=%{\"low-latency\"=>\"short delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer\",\"distributed\"=>\"(of a computer system) spread over several machines, especially over a network\",\"fault-tolerant\"=>\"relating to or being a computer or program with a self-contained backup system that allows continued operation when major components fail\"}for{word,definition}<-dictionarydoIO.puts\"#{word}:#{definition}\"endAs seen above, we can iterate through aRangeas well.forx<-0..99,y<-0..99do{x,y}end# [{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, ...]Bitstring generatorsThe generators we’ve seen so far have been “list generators”. The other type of generator is the “bitstring generator”. The bitstring generator allows you to easily loop over a bitstring while correctly parsing bytes.For a primer on bitstrings, please see the fantastic guide onelixir-lang.org.This is often very useful when parsing binary protocols like database protocols. Below is an example that demonstrates that each iteration of the comprehension reads the message length and then uses it to know how much more of the bitstring to read next. While the previous examples could be translated into various form ofEnum.map/2, this example can only be achieved with normal recursion.bitstring=<<1,\"I\",6,\"really\",4,\"love\",4,\"list\",14,\"comprehensions\",1,\"!\">># <<1, 73, 6, 114, 101, 97, 108, 108, 121, 4, 108, 111, 118, 101, 4, 108, 105,#  115, 116, 14, 99, 111, 109, 112, 114, 101, 104, 101, 110, 115, 105, 111, 110,#  115, 1, 33>>for<<message_length::integer,message::binary-size(message_length)<-bitstring>>domessageend# [\"I\", \"really\", \"love\", \"list\", \"comprehensions\", \"!\"]The example using recursion looks like:defmoduleFordodefloop(\"\"),do:[]defloop(<<message_length::integer,message::binary-size(message_length),rest::binary>>)do[message|loop(rest)]endendbitstring=<<1,\"I\",6,\"really\",4,\"love\",4,\"list\",14,\"comprehensions\",1,\"!\">>For.loop(bitstring)# [\"I\", \"really\", \"love\", \"list\", \"comprehensions\", \"!\"]To compare the two styles, let’s look at the syntax of the generator in the comprehension example and the second function head ofloopin the function example.In the function example, you’ll see that we pattern match on the bitstring in a similar manner to who you pattern match on a list. We pull several individual items off the beginning of the bitstring (message_length::integer, message::binary-size(message_length)) and we pattern match on the “rest” of the bitstring withrest::binary.The list equivalent looks like:defmoduleFordodefloop([]),do:[]defloop([_length,message|rest])do[message|loop(rest)]endendlist=[1,\"I\",6,\"really\",4,\"love\",4,\"list\",14,\"comprehensions\",1,\"!\"]For.loop(list)# [\"I\", \"really\", \"love\", \"list\", \"comprehensions\", \"!\"]Now if we compare this to the bitstring generator, we can see the similarity (with a caveat). Thelhsof the bitstring generator is the pattern match on the individual items and therhsis pattern matching on the “rest”. The caveat is thatbitstringhere is not actually the “rest” on each iteration, it is still the entire bitstring. I find this the best analogy to describe how the bitstring generator works since it is different enough from the “normal” list generator.#   👇 individual item         👇 individual item                      👇restfor<<message_length::integer,message::binary-size(message_length)<-bitstring>>do# 👇 this will print the same thing every timeIO.inspect(bitstring)messageendChaining generatorsList comprehensions allow you to chain generators together by using thelhsvalue from a generator in therhsof a subsequent generator.Here’s an example that demonstrates getting a list of all of your friends hobbies:friends=[%{name:\"Derek\",hobbies:[\"Movies\",\"Hot Sauce\"]},%{name:\"Joe\",hobbies:[\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\",\"Tattoos\"]},%{name:\"Andres\",hobbies:[\"Photoshop\",\"Oreos\",\"Cereal\"]},]for%{hobbies:hobbies}<-friends,hobby<-hobbiesdohobbyend# [\"Movies\", \"Hot Sauce\", \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\", \"Tattoos\", \"Photoshop\", \"Oreos\", \"Cereal\"]Generators filter non-matching lhs valuesIf the match expression in thelhsof a generator does not match on the value yielded from therhs, it will be rejected, and the list comprehension will move on to the next element in the enumerable.This is slightly surprising behavior at first and should be kept in mind when using list comprehensions. The following example might lead to a bug in your program.friends=[%{\"name\"=>\"Derek\"},%{name:\"Joe\"}]for%{name:name}<-friendsdonameend# [\"Joe\"]If you were to have written this program usingEnum.map/2, you would have ran into a function clause error.friends=[%{\"name\"=>\"Derek\"},%{name:\"Joe\"}]Enum.map(friends,fn%{name:name}->nameend)# ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in :erl_eval.\"-inside-an-interpreted-fun-\"/1##    The following arguments were given to :erl_eval.\"-inside-an-interpreted-fun-\"/1:##        # 1#        %{\"name\" => \"Derek\"}##    (stdlib 3.17.1) :erl_eval.\"-inside-an-interpreted-fun-\"/1#    (stdlib 3.17.1) erl_eval.erl:834: :erl_eval.eval_fun/6#    (elixir 1.13.3) lib/enum.ex:1593: Enum.\"-map/2-lists^map/1-0-\"/2This behaviour can be useful! If you only wanted to iterate over configuration options that are enabled, you could write something like this:configs=[%{name::feature_a,enabled:true},%{name::feature_b,enabled:false},%{name::feature_c,enabled:true}]for%{enabled:true}=config<-configsdoconfigend# [%{name: :feature_a, enabled: true}, %{name: :feature_c, enabled: true}]FiltersNow that we’ve talked aboutgenerator filtering, let’s talk aboutFilters.So far we have seen one type of “argument” that can be passed to the comprehension, the generator. Another “argument” is the filter! Let’s look at a quick example.In this example, we iterate over a list of employees, filter based on the employees status, and return a list of the employee’s namesemployees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active}]foremployee<-employees,employee.status==:activedoemployee.nameend# [\"Eric\", \"Greg\"]As with generators, filters can use values bound in a previous step of the comprehension. And like generators, you can use multiple filters as well. You can even mix and match them!employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Text Adventures\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Chickens\",type::animals}]},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former,hobbies:[%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making},%{name:\"Homebrewing\",type::making}]},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Dungeons & Dragons\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making}]}]foremployee<-employees,employee.status==:active,hobby<-employee.hobbies,hobby.type==:gamingdo{employee.name,hobby}end# [#   {\"Eric\", %{name: \"Text Adventures\", type: :gaming}},#   {\"Greg\", %{name: \"Dungeons & Dragons\", type: :gaming}}# ]At this point we can recognize that the list comprehension has the characteristics of a function withvariadic arguments. If we were to write our ownforusing plain functions, we’d have to pass it a list of callbacks to evaluate and a final callback to do the mapping. While we aren’t necessarily concerned with how we’d implementforas a plain function, it’s important to recognize aspects that are “different” from “normal” constructs in the language.One of the great things about the list comprehension is that it allows you to operate onEnumerabledata structures in fewer passes (usually 1) than when using theEnummodule.We can write our previous example using functions like so:employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active}]employees|>Enum.filter(fnemployee->employee.status==:activeend)|>Enum.map(fnemployee->employee.nameend)# [\"Eric\", \"Greg\"]employees|>Enum.reduce([],fnemployee,acc->ifemployee.status==:activedo[employee.name|acc]elseaccendend)|>Enum.reverse()# [\"Eric\", \"Greg\"]:lists.filtermap(fnemployee->ifemployee.status==:activedo{true,employee.name}elsefalseendend,employees)# [\"Eric\", \"Greg\"]You can see benchmarks of all of these styles of “filter map”here.OptionsNow that we’ve covered the basic principles of the list comprehension, we can explore the various options that can be passed to augment it’s behavior. The default behavior is to act more or less likeEnum.map/2with regard to the return type.As of this writing, there are three options available::uniq,:into, and:reduce:uniq:uniqis the least interesting of the available options, but still quite powerful.It simply ensures that the return result will only contain unique values.employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Text Adventures\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Chickens\",type::animals}]},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former,hobbies:[%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making},%{name:\"Homebrewing\",type::making}]},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Dungeons & Dragons\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making}]}]foremployee<-employees,hobby<-employee.hobbies,uniq:truedohobby.nameend# [\"Text Adventures\", \"Chickens\", \"Woodworking\", \"Homebrewing\", \"Dungeons & Dragons\"]You can see benchmarks of all of these styles of “map uniq”here.:into:intois where things start to get interesting.The default behavior for a list comprehension behaves more or less like a “map” operation, meaning that the expression evaluates to a list.The:intooption allows you to instead push the value returned by each iteration into acollectable. A data structure is collectable if it implements theCollectableprotocol.If you aren’t familiar with protocols, you have already been using them! TheEnummodule is a set of functions that operate on data structures that implement theEnumerableprotocol. The builtin data structures that implement theEnumerableprotocol are theList,Range,Map, andMapSettypes.The builtin data structures that implement theCollectableprotocol areList,Map,MapSet, andBitString. TheEnumfunction that you would use to take advantage of this protocol isEnum.into/2.Let’s take a look at some examples.ListUsing a list as the:intoactually doesn’t change the behavior at all!employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Text Adventures\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Chickens\",type::animals}]},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former,hobbies:[%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making},%{name:\"Homebrewing\",type::making}]},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Dungeons & Dragons\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making}]}]foremployee<-employees,employee.status==:active,hobby<-employee.hobbies,hobby.type==:gaming,into:[]do{employee.name,hobby}end# [#   {\"Eric\", %{name: \"Text Adventures\", type: :gaming}},#   {\"Greg\", %{name: \"Dungeons & Dragons\", type: :gaming}}# ]MapBut if we use a map, we can see that it pushes each key/value pair into the map that you pass for the option. Usually I use this with an empty map (%{}orMap.new()), but let’s look at an example using a non-empty map.employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Text Adventures\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Chickens\",type::animals}]},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former,hobbies:[%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making},%{name:\"Homebrewing\",type::making}]},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Dungeons & Dragons\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making}]}]base_map=%{\"Mitch\"=>%{name:\"Reading\",type::learning},\"Greg\"=>%{name:\"Traveling\",type::expensive}}foremployee<-employees,employee.status==:active,hobby<-employee.hobbies,hobby.type==:gaming,into:base_mapdo{employee.name,hobby}end# %{#   \"Eric\" => %{name: \"Text Adventures\", type: :gaming},#   \"Greg\" => %{name: \"Dungeons & Dragons\", type: :gaming},#   \"Mitch\" => %{name: \"Reading\", type: :learning}# }Here we can observe three things.The comprehension evaluates to a map.The\"Mitch\"key and its value were preserved in the final output.The\"Greg\"key’s value in thebase_mapwas overwritten by the value yielded during the comprehension with the same key. If our comprehension were to have returned multiple key/value pairs with identical keys, the last one would have won.This option is very useful for transforming maps. Since iterating over a map with anEnumfunction turns it into a list of 2-tuples, you always need to pipe the return value intoEnum.into/2orMap.new/1.employees=[%{name:\"Eric\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Text Adventures\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Chickens\",type::animals}]},%{name:\"Mitch\",status::former,hobbies:[%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making},%{name:\"Homebrewing\",type::making}]},%{name:\"Greg\",status::active,hobbies:[%{name:\"Dungeons & Dragons\",type::gaming},%{name:\"Woodworking\",type::making}]}]base_map=%{\"Mitch\"=>%{name:\"Reading\",type::learning},\"Greg\"=>%{name:\"Traveling\",type::expensive}}employees|>Enum.filter(fnemployee->employee.status==:activeend)|>Enum.flat_map(fnemployee->employee.hobbies|>Enum.filter(fnhobby->hobby.type==:gamingend)|>Enum.map(fnhobby->{employee.name,hobby}end)end)|>Enum.into(base_map)# %{#   \"Eric\" => %{name: \"Text Adventures\", type: :gaming},#   \"Greg\" => %{name: \"Dungeons & Dragons\", type: :gaming},#   \"Mitch\" => %{name: \"Reading\", type: :learning}# }Strings and BitStringsYou can build strings and bitstrings with the:intooption as well!This is useful when you want to build a string or a binary out of a list or map all in one pass. Let’s take a look at an example of creating an “attribute string” for use with HTML.attributes=[class:\"font-bold text-red-500 underline\",id:\"error-text\",data_controller:\"error-controller\"]for{property,value}<-attributes,into:\"\"doproperty=property|>to_string()|>String.replace(\"_\",\"-\")~s| #{property}=\"#{value}\"|end# \" class=\\\"font-bold text-red-500 underline\\\" id=\\\"error-text\\\" data-controller=\\\"error-controller\\\"\":reduceMy favorite option to the comprehension is:reduce!Reduce allows us to change the comprehension from behaving like a “map” operation to a “reduce” operation. This means that it will loop over an enumerable, but collect an “accumulator” instead.Let’s take a look at the first example in theEnum.reduce/3documentation and then convert it to a comprehension. This example produces the sum of a list of integers.Enum.reduce([1,2,3],0,fnx,acc->x+accend)# 6We can express this as a comprehension like so:forx<-[1,2,3],reduce:0doacc->x+accend# 6There are two immediate things we can observe.First, the:reduceoption takes a value that is to be used as the first value of the accumulator.Second, the comprehension in this mode includes a slightly different syntax. Here the inside of the block includes the “arg(s) and right arrow” syntax that you see in anonymous functions and case expressions. This is the syntax that allows the comprehensions to yield the accumulator to the block on every iteration.The additional syntax is the same as the other places you have probably seen it; you can pattern match and pass additional clauses!directions=[left:2,up:1,down:5,right:6]# You can't move below or to the left of 0.starting_position={0,0}for{dir,movement}<-directions,reduce:starting_positiondo{x,y}whendir==:leftandx-movement>0->{x-movement,y}{x,y}whendir==:downandy-movement>0->{x,y-movement}{x,y}whendir==:up->{x,y+movement}{x,y}whendir==:right->{x+movement,y}position->IO.puts(\"Not possible to move#{dir}by#{movement}when you care located at#{inspect(position)}\")positionend# {6, 1}Above we can observe that we’ve written 5 different clauses, pattern matched on the shape of the data, as well as added guard clauses that capture the data in the generator and the accumulator.The beauty of using a comprehension as a reducer is the ability to use multiple generators and act on them as if they are one level of iteration.friends=[%{name:\"Derek\",hobbies:[\"Movies\",\"Hot Sauce\"]},%{name:\"Joe\",hobbies:[\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\",\"Tattoos\"]},%{name:\"Andres\",hobbies:[\"Photoshop\",\"Oreos\",\"Cereal\"]},]for%{hobbies:hobbies,name:name}<-friends,hobby<-hobbies,reduce:[]dotagged_hobbies->[{name,hobby}|tagged_hobbies]end# [#   {\"Andres\", \"Cereal\"},#   {\"Andres\", \"Oreos\"},#   {\"Andres\", \"Photoshop\"},#   {\"Joe\", \"Tattoos\"},#   {\"Joe\", \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\"},#   {\"Derek\", \"Hot Sauce\"},#   {\"Derek\", \"Movies\"}# ]To write this without a comprehension it would look something like:Enum.reduce(friends,[],fn%{name:name,hobbies:hobbies},tagged_hobbies->new_hobbies=Enum.map(hobbies,fnhobby->{name,hobby}end)new_hobbies++tagged_hobbiesend)ConclusionIf you’ve made it this far, congrats! The comprehension packs a lot of features into a tiny programming construct and demonstrating all of them is a lot of work!The comprehension is one of my favorite features of the Elixir programming language, and it was a pleasure to write about every feature in as much depth as I could.If you have any questions about comprehensions or want to suggest examples or features that I’ve missed, feel free to reach out onTwitteroremail.Supplementary InformationList Comprehensions in ErlangIt would be remiss to not mention that the list comprehension also exists in Erlang. I am not personally familiar with them, so I won’t explain them very much, but I I’ll provide an example and a link to learn more about them on your own.The following examples are from the official Erlang/OTP documentation and can be foundhere.[X||X<-[1,2,a,3,4,b,5,6],is_integer(X),X>3].% [4, 5, 6][{X,Y}||X<-[1,2,3],Y<-[a,b]].% [{1, a}, {1, b}, {2, a}, {2, b}, {3, a}, {3, b}]Thank you to Seth Brown, Eric Oestrich, and Kevin Rankin for their help reviewing this article.If you want to stay current with what I'm working on and articles I write, join my mailing list!I seldom send emails, and I willnevershare your email address with anyone else.built withJekyll,TailwindCSS, and♥Mastodon\n",

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA WireKarlin LillingtonThu Jun 29 2023 - 05:00Two extraordinary, last-minute actions by the Government this week trample on democracy, will further exacerbate unresolved dilemmas mostly of the Government’s own making and are certain to create further international, reputation-damaging complications in the future.These are, first, the secretive, closed-door hearing Monday during which Minister for Justice Helen McEntee imposed 12-month blanket communications data retention on the Irish population and, second, a stupefying proposedamendmentintroduced only last week to year-old draft legislation, allowing the Irish Data Protection Commission to gag public discussion of what it determines to be “confidential” elements of any complaints it is considering. The bill passed a Dáil vote last night.Each makes Ireland look less and less like an open and transparent democracy and more like a state beholden to and manipulated by powerful interests.In the case of McEntee’s data retention order, those interests include security agencies and a justice department that has, at great taxpayer and societal cost, continued to ignore the landmark decade-old Digital Rights Ireland decision by Europe’s highest court – the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). The ECJ ruling involving Ireland’s data retention laws required Ireland to introduce better, EU-compliant legislation governing the collection, storage and use of highly sensitive communications data.READ MOREData decisions create dark day for Irish democracyData centres: We don’t need to be world leaders in these low-employment electricity vacuumsAs the US dithers, the EU is setting the global agenda on tech regulationApple’s Vision Pro feels as potentially transformative as the iPhone once didThe State chose not to be inconvenienced by this binding EU decision that has since become the foundation of successive ECJ data protection rulings. Exactly as predicted by digital rights advocates, the State’s inaction opened a door for challenges to serious criminal convictions secured using data that continued to be obtained under an invalidated law. The cases brought by convicted murderer Graham Dwyer are one result.[McEntee to seek private hearing of court application under law dealing with Dwyer data challenge, digital rights group claims][Minister says phone data retention order will ‘safeguard’ State security]After the ECJ last year made clear to the Government that Dwyer did have a valid case, the State hurried through new data protection legislation. Unfortunately, it did so in a haphazard, rushed way (again, in a week). The State failed to put the proposed law through a necessary EU consultative process, rendering the law unfit for purpose.Hence, McEntee’s rushed order last week, granted in a closed court hearing, after she argued that the State needed to impose a stop-gap 12-month data-retention regime.Numerous ECJ data protection and retention rulings in recent years have mandated the need for openness, transparency, public discussion, clear checks and balances, and proportionality. That baseline requirement for informed discussion and balanced protections would not seem to be met by failing to enact a fresh law for a decade, then quickly introducing an order, without Dáil or public input or response, beyond scrutiny and behind closed doors.The so-called section 26 Amendment to the Data Protection Bill, a ministerial amendment put forward by Department of Justice junior minister James Browne, is equally appalling. It grants the Data Protection Commission (DPC) the right to ban discussion of elements of a complaint it determines to be confidential or business-sensitive.This appears to be an anti-Max Schrems move, as the well-known Austrian lawyer and data protection campaigner whose name is attached to two significant CJEU decisions has drawn the ire of the DPC and Meta/Facebook for publicly discussing elements of his complaints. Meta/Facebook has its EU headquarters in Ireland, is on the Government lobby record and is overseen by the DPC.The Department of Justice responded  to vociferous national and international objections – including from Amnesty International, BEUC (the representative body for EU consumer rights organisations), and EDRi (the representative organisation for more than 40 European digital rights groups),insistingthat the amendment was limited in scope and would not shut down all discussion.But legal experts, including those at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, havearguedthat the amendment is so broad and open to interpretation that it  gives inappropriate powers with little accountability to a DPC already internationally criticised for a lack of transparency in its decisions.[Facebook owner granted stay on order that it suspend Europe-US data transfers][Court continues stay on decision that Meta must suspend EU-US data transfer]As solicitor and director of Data Compliance Europe, Simon McGarr tweeted: “What is particularly striking is that the Dept of Justice is trying to deal with widespread – at a EU and even global level – criticism of DPC processes without addressing any of the things it is criticised for. Instead, it is looking to stifle complaints.”Other EU national data protection officers have adjudicated on commercially sensitive issues involving global tech multinationals and have not found it necessary or appropriate to gag discussion. Doing so appears to be in conflict with GDPR complaint mechanisms and  its focus on balance, proportionality and transparency. The amendment will undoubtedly be challenged here or in Europe.But the damage to Ireland is already done by both State moves this week, regardless of whether the amendment had passed or been dropped.In even proposing (and even worse, passing) such an amendment, and enacting the data retention order, Ireland has added to a decade of national legal stumbles in this extremely important and increasingly topical area of digital protection. It is to Ireland’s continuing shame and international embarrassment that the State remains so inept in implementing and enforcing data protection laws, especially when Ireland carries regulatory responsibility for the world’s most powerful data-gathering multinationals.Karlin LillingtonMax SchremsData Protection CommissionData PrivacyHelen McEnteeJames BrowneEuropean Court Of JusticeGraham DwyerDigital Rights IrelandSimon McGarrIrish Council For Civil LibertiesMetaFacebookDepartment of JusticeIN THIS SECTIONPoolbeg Pharma uses AI to identify potential drug targets for flu treatmentSoftware firm makes environmental, social and governance issues that bit easierGoogle Pixel tablet gets first makeover in five yearsIs Sam Altman, the ‘father of ChatGPT’, the most important thinker in the world right now?Data decisions create dark day for Irish democracyMOST READMiriam Lord: Where is Dee Forbes?

(B.K. Bangash/AP)Listen4 minComment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareLike one of the endangered species whose impending extinction it has chronicled, National Geographic magazine has been on a relentlessly downward path, struggling for vibrancy in an increasingly unforgiving ecosystem.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn Wednesday, the Washington-based magazine that has surveyed science and the natural world for 135 years reached another difficult passage when it laid off all of its last remaining staff writers.The cutback — the latest in a series under owner Walt Disney Co. — involves some 19 editorial staffers in all, who were notified in April that these terminations were coming. Article assignments will henceforth be contracted out to freelancers or pieced together by editors. The cuts also eliminated the magazine’s small audio department.The layoffs were the second over the past nine months, and the fourth since a series of ownership changes began in 2015. In September, Disneyremoved six top editorsin an extraordinary reorganization of the magazine’s editorial operations.AdvertisementDeparting staffers said Wednesday the magazine has curtailed photo contracts that enabled photographers to spend months in the field producing the publication’s iconic images.In a further cost-cutting move, copies of the famous bright-yellow-bordered print publication will no longer be sold on newsstands in the United States starting next year, the company said in an internal announcement last month.National Geographic writer Craig Welch noted the moment in a tweet on Wednesday: “My new National Geographic just arrived, which includes my latest feature — my 16th, and my last as a senior writer. … I’ve been so lucky. I got to work w/incredible journalists and tell important, global stories. It’s been an honor.”The magazine’s current trajectory has been years in the making, set in motion primarily by the epochal decline of print and ascent of digital news and information. In the light-speed world of digital media, National Geographic has remained an almost artisanal product — a monthly magazine whose photos, graphics and articles were sometimes the result of months of research and reporting.AdvertisementAt its peak in the late 1980s, National Geographic reached 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more overseas. Many of its devotees so savored its illumination of other worlds — space, the depths of the ocean, little-seen parts of the planet — that they stacked old issues into piles that cluttered attics and basements.It remains among the most widely read magazines in America, at a time when magazines are no longer widely read. At the end of 2022, it hadjust under 1.8 million subscribers,according to the authoritative Alliance for Audited Media.National Geographic was launched by Washington’s National Geographic Society, a foundation formed by 33 academics, scientists and would-be adventurers, including Alexander Graham Bell. The magazine was initially sold to the public as a perk for joining the society. It grew into a stand-alone publication slowly but steadily, reaching 1 million subscribers by the 1930s.AdvertisementThe magazine was eventually surpassed for profits and attention by the society’s video operations, including its flagship National Geographic cable channel and Nat Geo Wild, a channel focused on animals. While they produced documentaries equal in quality to the magazine’s rigorous reporting, the channels — managed by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox — also aired pseudoscientific entertainment programming about UFOs and reality series like “Sharks vs. Tunas” at odds with the society’s original high-minded vision.The magazine’s place of honor continued to dim through a series of corporate reshufflings that began in 2015 when the Society agreed to forma for-profit partnershipwith 21st Century Fox, which took majority control in exchange for $725 million. The partnership came under the Disney banner in 2019 as part of a massive $71 billion deal between Fox and Disney.Among those who lost their jobs in the latest layoff was Debra Adams Simmons, who only last September was promoted to vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion at National Geographic Media, the entity that oversees the magazine and website.AdvertisementAt the time, David Miller, executive vice president of National Geographic Media, said the magazine was “realigning key departments to help deepen engagement with our readers while also nurturing existing business models and developing new lines of revenue.”In an email to The Post on Wednesday, National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert said staffing changes will not affect the company’s plans to continue publishing a monthly magazine “but rather give us more flexibility to tell different stories and meet our audiences where they are across our many platforms.”CommentsGift this articleGift ArticleLoading...View moreTOP STORIESFeel-good storiesNews that brims with optimismA dog has retrieved 155 discs from woods.

      "The article discusses the increasing popularity of usage-based car insurance among customers. Usage-based car insurance, also known as pay-per-mile or pay-as-you-drive insurance, is a type of coverage that determines insurance rates based on an individual's driving behavior. This form of insurance relies on telematics technology, such as GPS and on-board diagnostics, to track and gather data on miles driven, time of day, and driving habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article highlights several factors that have contributed to the growing acceptance of usage-based car insurance. One of the main reasons is the potential for cost savings it offers to low-mileage drivers. By paying only for the miles they actually drive, policyholders can potentially reduce their insurance expenses significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the greater adoption of connected car technologies and the increasing availability of telematics devices have made it easier for insurance companies to implement usage-based car insurance. This allows insurers to adjust premiums more accurately based on the driving habits of individual policyholders, rather than relying solely on general demographic factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also mentions that as usage-based car insurance becomes more popular, traditional insurance companies are facing competition from new entrants in the industry, including technology firms and startups specializing in telematics and data analytics. This increasing competition is expected to drive innovation and result in more personalized insurance offerings in the future.\n",

The article highlights the challenges faced in accurately counting and evaluating the health of these ecosystems and explains how OpenORCA offers a solution.\\n\\nOpenORCA is designed to analyze imagery and video footage of coral reefs and automate the process of species identification and counting. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to classify and quantify various reef components such as corals, fish, and benthic organisms. The tool also provides metrics for assessing reef health, including coral cover and diversity indices.\\n\\nThe development of OpenORCA aims to address the limitations of manual surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. By automating the counting and assessment process, OpenORCA not only increases efficiency but also enhances accuracy and repeatability. The open-source nature of the tool encourages collaboration and enables researchers and conservationists to contribute to its further development.\\n\\nIn conclusion, OpenORCA is a valuable open-source tool that offers a more efficient and accurate way to monitor and evaluate coral reefs. By providing automated species identification, counting capabilities, and health assessment metrics, it plays a crucial role in conservation efforts and helps researchers obtain essential data to inform management decisions.', 'text': 'OpenOrcaEric\\'s CodeFollowEric\\'s CodeFollowOpenOrcaEric Hartford·Jun 29, 2023·3min readToday I am announcing OpenOrca, an open-source dataset and series of instruct-tuned language models.As I readOrca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4by Mukherjee et. al. of Microsoft, I had to consider the implications for Open Source AI.This was pretty awesome stuff. But, I realized that while Microsoft would probably release their LLaMA-13b based model (as of the time of this writing they still haven\\'t) I concluded that they might not release the dataset.Therefore, I resolved to replicate their efforts, download the data myself, and train the model myself, so that OpenOrca can be released on other sizes of LLaMA as well as other foundational models such as Falcon, OpenLLaMA, RedPajama, MPT, RWKV.This was a nontrivial undertaking. With the help of an all-star team of open-source AI/ML engineers, we have completed the OpenOrca dataset.Our dataset consists of:~1 million of FLANv2 augmented with GPT-4 completions~3.5 million of FLANv2 augmented with GPT-3.5 completionsWe followed the submix and system prompt distribution outlined in the Orca paper. With a few exceptions. We included all 75k of CoT in the FLAN-1m dataset rather than sampling that. Also, we found that many items were duplicated so we removed duplicates, resulting in 3.5m instructs in the ChatGPT dataset.We are presently performing full weights fine-tuning of OpenOrca on the foundation of LLaMA-13b, so that our performance can be compared with Microsoft\\'s model when it releases.We expect to release OpenOrca-LLaMA-13b in mid-July 2023. At that time we will publish our evaluation findings and the dataset.We are currently seeking GPU compute sponsors for training OpenOrca on the following platforms:Falcon 7b, 40bLLaMA 7b, 13b, 33b, 65bMPT-7b, 30bAny other targets that get a sponsor. (RWKV, OpenLLaMA)From the Orca paper and our experiments, we roughly estimate the compute costs as follows:Model SizeCompute Estimate7b1k GPU-Hours13b2k GPU-Hours30/33b4k-6k GPU-Hours40b8k-10k GPU-Hours65b10k-15k GPU-HoursWe will share our appreciation for sponsorship in this space, as well as the model cards.Our current sponsors:Financial Contribution and mentorship -chirper.aiLLaMA 7b -preemo.ioLLaMA 33b -latitude.shPlease reach out to me if you are interested in providing compute sponsorship for any specific targets of OpenOrca.I would like to thank the motley crew of Open Source AI/ML engineers who have worked beside me in this endeavor.
