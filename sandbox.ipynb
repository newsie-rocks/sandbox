White Rabbit uses Synchronous Ethernet-based network and a high-precision time and frequency distribution protocol (PTP) to achieve 1 ns accuracy for time transfer and 1 ps accuracy for frequency transfer, with sub-ns precision in both cases. The technology is being developed as an open-source project, with the goal of making it widely available to the scientific community and beyond.\"\n",
